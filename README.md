Built using NextJS

Todo:
- [ ] Add 2 Youtube videos in front of Project page, split between the screen on desktop,
not show up on phone 
- [ ] Add full-text search engine to blog posts:\
  - it is possible to extract all blog posts to json file, then [index](lunrjs.com) it.
  - Or we can go [sqlite](https://sql.js.org/#/) route
Wonder if static page can have a search engine
- [x] Add year/month filter to blog posts
  - [ ] Count posts in month, year
