8:T46e,According to Mr. Geerling, he had a public IP (though not static) and
pointed his domain to this IP to connect to his network using Wireguard
installed by PiVPN. I do not have such luxury, as my public IP is
10.x.x.x through PPPoE to my ISP, Viettel, so using his way was out of
the question. I am stuck in a situation known as CGNAT. What's more, he
exposed ALL his network out, which, to each of their own, is quite
dangerous as the VPN can be used as an attack vector to your own
network. I did a similar thing while creating my own VOIP service using
Asterisk, but it only lasted a day, and I quickly closed it due to the
danger behind it. PiVPN, the tool he used, is quite fascinating and I
will look into it in the future. But back when I built my VPN, it was on
a virtual server, and I built it manually. I didn't know any automated
tool like his, I just followed some guides from DigitalOcean to set up
Wireguard, along with fail2ban, ssh. In fact, the reason I chose
Wireguard was that it was easier to set up. OpenVPN has a lot of moving
parts needed to run, while Wireguard only requires a pair of keys.
