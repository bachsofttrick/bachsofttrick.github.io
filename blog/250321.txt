Not going so far back that they\nlose out to their parents, who probably even know how to open a browser to go on the Internet. I guess,\nwith the proliferation of apps, i.e. everything being made into an app, it turns any low-level concept\ninto an abstraction, like how Python displaced C as the first language taught to the kids, or new Computer\nScience undergraduate.
