8:T771,I'm no stranger to using cellular network for Internet. I knew of its
existence back in the early days of Vietnamese Internet. It was 2G
network when I was 7 with my dad's Samsung slide phone. Back when it was
ridiculously expensive because there was no data plan, you were billed
by kilobyte so it was more of a novelty then a necessity like today.
I've come to use it frequently since the day I got my first my
smartphone, which was back in 2014, with my country utilizing 3G
network, superseding 2G. 4G came about in 2016 or so. The three major
cell networks: Viettel, Mobifone, Vinaphone, rolled out the carpet to
welcome the new standard. I chose Viettel at the time because as a
college student, money is pretty tight. So 30.000 VND/2,5 GB is a
reasonable data plan as I do not use social media much at the time and
Youtube could be watched at home. In 2019, iTel, a MVNO (mobile virtual
network operator) using Vinaphone as backbone, launched with a plan:
77.000 VND for 3GB per day. I only found out in 2021 through a flyer at
the post office, because MVNOs here aren't known for their massive ad
campaigns. Wanting to give it a test drive, I bought a sim and gave it
to my sister, who used Facebook more than I do. She said it was good and
didn't feel restricted by other networks' limited data caps. For
references, 3GB/day equals to 90GB/month, far exceeded anything that
were offered at the time. The other networks soon followed up with their
own monthly "data cap per day" mode like this. Then I stumbled upon a
data plan of Vinaphone: 500GB for 150.000 VND. That sounded good enough
to me, and I'm not one to pass up an offer that good. So I bought a
Vinaphone sim, replaced my aging Viettel one with it, and tested the
network. It was good, though signal is a bit weak compared to Viettel.
The data plan also comes with 5 Mbps if exceeded. I've been using
Vinaphone on my phone ever since.2:[["$","p",null,{"children":"Have you ever got a feeling that you would never go back once you tried\nsomething that was way better than you expected?
