a:T407,The first thing that caught my eye is that they asked you to pay for the
OS. I was planning to skip this OS when I tried typing zero into the
price and it allowed me to download again. Usually in other OSes, they
ask you before you download if you'd like to donate them some money.
This one essentially tricked you into thinking that you have to buy it.
Well, maybe there's a reason for that. I installed the OS and ran it. It
looked very good. There have been works done to make Elementary OS look
like a beautiful piece of art. Quite like macOS except I liked this way
more. That is Pantheon desktop environment, by the way. Like Linux Mint,
they use software manager called AppCenter to manage all packages. But I
had to give this OS a pass. Because when I tried installing NVIDIA
driver on and restarted my PC, the desktop environment stopped showing,
leaving the terminal behind. So there were some bugs or compatibility
problems with Pantheon. Maybe if I had an AMD GPU or using Intel CPU, I
could use it a bit longer. Shame!2:[["$","p",null,{"children":"I have just bought a couple of SSDs for cheap on Facebook.
