a:T5a8,PPPoE is a network protocol for using PPP on Ethernet. Back in the old
days, PPP is used for dial-up Internet access. Nowadays, PPPoE is used
for customer authentication, record on DSL network, fiber network. When
you register for Internet service, your provider will give you a
username for the PPPoE account, and they pre-configured the account in
their modem with the password. Then from the modem, you would connect
another, better router to it, use it as the main point to connect to the
Internet for all devices in your house. The reason is that ISP modems
are usually weak, unreliable if left to handle anything to heavy. But by
using 2 routers, this leads to a situation called "double NAT", where
traffic coming to and from a client has to route twice before hitting
the Internet, increasing latency and causing problems to programs that
need to open port. The first drawback is why you would want to turn your
modem to bridge mode, so the router has to do most of the heavy lifting,
the modem's only job is conversion from fiber to Ethernet. The second
downside is kind of meaningless, as in IPv4, you most likely have an IP
address given by the ISP, which allows Internet access but the outside
world can't connect to you because a lot of users around your house also
have that same address (which is a large problem if you want to do
anything involving P2P like torrenting, VOIP, online gaming. Fixing this
is a story for another time).2:[["$","p",null,{"children":"After a blog series about using 4G as house Wifi, I need an short\narticle to breathe a bit.
