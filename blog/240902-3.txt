8:T476, their .NET Core codebase. Because at the time, I didn't
understand what MVC was for, and many more intricacies in the underlying
structure of their codebase. I often argued with their senior developer
about the necessity of such baggage like interface, dependency
injection. To this day, I still can't see the reason. Maybe because
I'm ignorant to them, or I don't have the view of the bigger picture,
as most my web applications are quite small, a simple ExpressJS with a
couple of APIs should do it. That's why I was ecstatic when we move on
to other backend frameworks. My favorite at the time was NestJS. It was
built upon ExpressJS, so right up my alley. And since a new codebase
meant moving on from legacy baggages, no more problems from .NET Core
haunting me. Another thing I hated was I couldn't program the .NET
server on Linux, I could only use Windows with Visual Studio, a behemoth
IDE that ate up all of 12GB ram whenever I wanted to debug the program.
I could never find ways to debug on VS Code, better yet, create a new
.NET Web API project. Now with the discovery of .NET's command line,
maybe those could be done on Linux.2:[["$","p",null,{"children":"After not working for a while as a full stack developer, I got a new\njob. Now I'm about to be a web developer, again.
