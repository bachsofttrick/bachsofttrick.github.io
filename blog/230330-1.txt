8:T450,Like most folks around the world, in Vietnam, we watch television. In
particular, we watch it through cable. There are many cable TV providers
in Vietnam: VTV, HTVC from the government, SCTV of Saigontourist (yes, a
tourism company is also a cable provider), VTC. There are ISP like FPT,
Viettel, VNPT who also wanted a piece of television business and started
jumping in. My family chose SCTV, because it was one of the first
companies to provide cable TV, and has stuck with them since. My
grandparents also chose them as the cable provider, along with the
Internet service they provide as a combo. The reason for the included
Internet is that on weekends, we visit our grandparents and need some
connectivity for our Facebook and Youtube video consumption. My cousin,
who is working towards her college degree, also lives with our
grandparents and needs Internet to do her homework. Their speed is about
35 Mbps symmetrical (up and down speed is the same), which is not much
compared to my fiber at home, 150 Mbps symmetrical, but is good enough
for the purpose. They provided us a router and a modem.2:[["$","p",null,{"children":"Hi, you may not know me. That's fair, this is my first blog after all.\nYou can call me The Testing Guy.
