title: 'Patching OpenWrt with a new driver'
publishedAt: '2023-06-23'

I wrote a post on compiling OpenWrt from source a few months ago. Since
then, I've been playing around with its source, building new images with
it to test on virtual machines. OpenWrt finally added [support for
Orange Pi R1 Plus (LTS)](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/12818) for
their next release, 23.05. And with a new driver for RTL8153, a chipset
used in the board, I decided to go back to patching OpenWrt one more
time.

#### Kernel patch

As shown from my previous post on OpenWrt for Orange Pi R1 Plus, kernel
patches are how they affect the kernel to their preferences for running
OpenWrt, like allowing unsupported devices to run the OS. The Linux
kernel source has upstreamed dts for R1 Plus on v6.3 and LTS on v6.4,
and now is *backported* to kernel 5.15 for OpenWrt 23.05 using kernel
patches. Patches are created using either *diff* or *git diff*.

#### How to create diff

It's actually quite easy. Just follow this command:

*diff -rupN \<source\> \<target\> \> \<output\>*

With:

\- r to compare with subdirectories, subfolders

\- u outputs NUM (default 3) lines of unified context (yeah I don't get
it)

\- p shows which C function each change is in

\- N treats absent files as empty

Or:

*git diff \<source\> \<target\> \> \<output\>*

#### Patch new driver into the kernel

I first tried using */dev/null* as source to diff against *r8152.c* file
from Realtek, and then put it in as patch. I deleted a patch related to
*r8152.c* so it remained original to kernel source. I put the patch in
*target/linux/generic/hack-5.15*, same as where I deleted the previous
patch. But replacing the kernel driver wasn't easy, I tried

*\-\-- a/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*

*+++ /dev/null*

*\-\-- /dev/null*

*+++ b/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*

or

*\-\-- /dev/null*

*+++ b/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*

The source didn't compile due to the file already existing in the
kernel.

So I did the hard way. I went into *dl* folder, extract *r8152.c* from
*linux-5.15.117.tar.xz* (at the time OpenWrt was built on kernel
5.15.117) then diff against the same file from Realtek. It compiled
successfully. I could run it well on a virtual machine.

Apparently, the compiler doesn't read anything above the first change in
the patch. So the lines before that is considered comments to the
compiler. I added a note to say that this driver is not from the kernel
source.

#### Patch new driver into ImmortalWrt

I also used ImmortalWrt 21.02 for testing their software offloading
*TurboACC*. Originally, ImmortalWrt wouldn't compile with the original
source because of lack of 'libcap'. I found out that the library existed
in 22.03 of OpenWrt, not in 21.02 which was the base for ImmortalWrt. So
I copied it from OpenWrt at *package/libs/libcap* and took it to
ImmortalWrt. It compiled.

#### Test RTL8153 using OpenWrt

I tested it using my device and iperf3. The LAN port contains RTL8153
chipset and I tested it half-duplex, 1 download 1 upload separately.
Download from my laptop to the LAN port got me **940 Mbps**, which was
max bandwidth for **1 Gbps** Ethernet:

#### Test RTL8153 using ImmortalWrt

I also tested the RTL8153 chipset with ImmortalWrt 21.02 original
driver. It got me **940 Mbps** download:

#### Test YT8531c using OpenWrt and ImmortalWrt

I couldn't test the WAN port with YT8531c chipset. I couldn't get IP
address on my laptop, despite setting the WAN port to have the same
settings as the LAN port for DHCP. I did try in vain to patch it using
dts patch of the R1 Plus LTS board. As you can see, they had updated
Mootorcomm driver and the device tree source with new values like
clk-out-frequency-hz, keep-pll-enabled, auto-sleep-disabled. Maybe there
is something wrong with the driver, because this also happened on
ImmortalWrt 23.05. Using
[Armbian](https://github.com/armbian/community), however,
I could use the WAN port normally.

![](/images/blog/230623/patch_2305_not_possible_8531.jpg)

So in the end, OpenWrt 23.05 **shouldn't be used** just yet.

I rolled back to OpenWrt 22.03. I tested the WAN port with iperf3 again.

Download **940 Mbps**:

*\[ 5\] 0.00-5.00 sec 550 MBytes 923 Mbits/sec receiver*

ImmortalWrt 21.02 gave out similar results.

#### Note about offloading

These tests have been performed *with and without [software
offloading]*. Doesn't seem like it does anything. Whether
OpenWrt or *TurboACC* from ImmortalWrt. Packet steering also doesn't
work, either.

#### Reason for better performance on ImmortalWrt compared to OpenWrt

As you can see when using RTL8153 original driver, OpenWrt only reached
**630 Mbps** while ImmortalWrt got **720 Mbps** in iperf3 upload is
because, ImmortalWrt overclocked the processor, Rockchip RK3328, from
stock 1.3 Ghz to **1.6 Ghz**. ImmortalWrt has a patch where they add
clock frequencies to the [operating performance point (OPP)
table](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/opp.txt).
ImmortalWrt was running RK3328 at 1.6 Ghz max.
