This article follows this [post](https://kitson-consulting.co.uk/blog/apt-dpkg-purge-rc-packages).

I upgraded my Linux system today, from Lubuntu 22.04 to Lubuntu 24.04. So far, the upgrade was smooth, I haven't 
encountered any errors. Except when upgrading version, they replaced many apps with the new version's equivalents.
So many old apps were uninstalled and stuck at [residual-config].
So a way to solve this is through apt-get tool from Ubuntu and Debian.

To list packages that have been removed but still have configuration files left behind:
```
apt list '~c'
```
To remove the configuration files for packages that are no longer installed:
```
apt purge '~c'
```
