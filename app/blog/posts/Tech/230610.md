title: 'Getting my blog on Google Search'

After writing blogs for over a month, I checked to see if my blog showed
up on Google Search. And\... Nothing. So what? Why? How? Why doesn't my
blog exist in Google's eyes? So I asked a friend, he asked if I had put
my page on the search console. I wondered what that is. Turns out to be
the Google Search Console.

I went to [https://search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console). It showed me this
dialog.

I was supposed to provide the console with the domain I wanted to put on
the map, so I typed in this blog's domain in *Domain*. After that, it
led me to the dashboard.

I thought that was it and left it there. The following day, I opened up,
and it was still nothing, staring at me like suggesting that I do
something. Searching around, they said I need to put in my sitemap so
that Google has something to crawl and indexes pages to their search
engine. I didn't know what sitemap was. I found a [sitemap
generator](https://www.labnol.org/blogger/sitemap/) and it
gave me this answer.

*\# Blogger Sitemap created on Thu, 27 Apr 2023 12:15:06 GMT*

*\# Sitemap built with https://www.labnol.org/blogger/sitemap*

*User-agent: \**

*Disallow: /search*

*Allow: /*

*Sitemap:
https://testingguy96.blogspot.com/atom.xml?redirect=false&start-index=1&max-results=500*

![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230610/blogger_sitemap.jpg)

I could put this in my blog settings, under *Enable custom robots.txt*.
But I put the xml sitemap in *Sitemap* as
[https://testingguy96.blogspot.com/atom.xml](https://testingguy96.blogspot.com/atom.xml).
This
[article](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-recommends-using-xml-sitemaps-rssatom-feeds-optimal-crawling/118364/)
told me to also include xml sitemap, as the last one was an Atom one. It
was *sitemap.xml*.

Not wanting to wait for indexing, I decided to take matters into my own
hands. I gathered all my post URLs, put each of them to the search bar
on top, and requested index manually.

After about 3 days, I checked and my blog and its accompanying posts
started showing up. Mission successful! I also learned later that I need
to
[ping](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
Google to submit sitemap *again* for it to update my sitemap to get new
posts, and request indexing for new posts if I want updates right then.
