title: 'Breaking changes on Docker 29 and how to postpone it'

Recently I got an assignment that needs to use Docker. Usually it can be done with command
line, but a lot of time, I use Portainer for the convenience. But today, I wasn't able
to access my local Docker environment. It kept saying "the environment named local is unreachable".
I discovered that an update to Docker version 29 introduced [breaking changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/29/):
```
The daemon now requires API version 1.44 or later (Docker v25.0+).
```
A user named *JoynalFrametOlimpo* at this Github [issue](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/12925) showed me a way to downgrade the API version 1.41 by changing `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
```
{
    "min-api-version": "1.41",
    [Other settings down here...]
}
```
Afterwards, it just `systemctl restart docker.service` and Portainer worked again. Keep in mind
that I ran an older version of Portainer, 2.27.9 LTS, because I hate the UI change of the
[new versions](https://docs.portainer.io/release-notes#release-2.32.0-sts). Also, I don't want
to lose the "stacks" I deployed using Portainer.

In the future, I might have to migrate deploying "stacks" to actually using Docker Compose,
because everytime I change version on Portainer, I end up always re-deploying these Docker
Compose anyway, which is a giant waste of time. Seems like *reinventing the wheel* to me.
