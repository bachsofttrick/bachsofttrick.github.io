Did you see the picture? This is Panasonic RX-C36. It was released in the 1980s. I called it the
"Say Anything boombox", referencing that one scene where John Cusack's character held a boombox
above his head in front of the his girlfriend's house. When I plugged the radio in, it sounded like
nothing I have ever heard before from a casette stereo. It was full, warm, booming. And that was
on radio only. It was that good for only 15 dollars. Sadly I couldn't buy it. I don't intend to stick
around here for long, and having a big stereo around feels like a waste for me. It's hard to move
around, hard to sell. So I ended up with a smaller GPX R633B. Not as good, but at least better than
my crappy free CD stereo I got two years ago. I only need a FM radio, anyway.
