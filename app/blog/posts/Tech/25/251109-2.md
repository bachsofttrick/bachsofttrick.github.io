After the previous long post, this one is shorter.

I was reading this [post](https://truelogic.org/wordpress/2024/08/14/installing-llama-cpp-on-ubuntu-with-an-nvidia-gpu/).
And wanted to use `gpustat` as a way to continuously view GPU utilization. But using `watch -n1 gpustat` would wash
away the colors. And using `-c` was not helping. Luckily, lol (yes, that's a handle) had a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3793126/colors-with-unix-command-watch). It was to use `unbuffer` from `expect` 
package. So it's `watch -n1 -c unbuffer gpustat` and it will show colors.
