This article follows this [article](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/an-even-better-microsoft-account-bypass-for-windows-11-has-already-been-discovered).
A lot of time I install Windows 11, not only do I have to get through the TPM requirement, I also have to find a 
way to get through not logging in to my Microsoft account and set up a local account. Back then, the 'no@thankyou.com' email and whatever password worked. Then when that didn't work, I used
```
oobe\bypassnro
```
And now, those don't work anymore.

So somebody discovered a new way, or at least it has existed for a while. I just
cover it here, so I remember. I use this blog as a sort-of notebook to remember things as well.
```
start ms-cxh:localonly
```
And it launched a Windows 10 style new account screen.

I created a new account and press Next. Everything proceeded as normal.
