Do you find it annoying that some companies put a block on copy/paste on some input fields.
Understandable if it is a password retype, not so much for email retype. I guess it is to
double check for correctness, but it is a hell of annoyance for someone who needs to do
things quickly.
I found two ways to fix this:
- Select All (or Ctrl+A) the entire content, then drag to the input field that blocks
copy/paste.
- This one is for [Firefox](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1exi6ub/lpt_how_to_bypass_websites_that_block_copypaste/), access `about:config` and change `dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled` to `false`.
