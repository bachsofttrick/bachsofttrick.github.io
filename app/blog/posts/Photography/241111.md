I recently got into a new hobby, which is photography. At first, I wasn't sure I would like it.
Everyone seems to like taking so many photos nowadays, while I'm not too keen on that. I did view
some guides on the Internet. It taught me a few things about aperture, ISO, shutter speed, though that's
still quite hard to memorize. There were *Rule of Thirds*, *Leading Lines and Curves*, *Symmetry and Balance*,
etc.

Last Saturday, I went to District 2 Connecting Bridge and took some pictures for experimentation. The results
were staggering. They surprised me. They came out good. Maybe a more professional photographer might criticize
me but hey, I quite like this new venture. So now, I'm expanding my blog to include this category, and many more
to come if I'm interested.
