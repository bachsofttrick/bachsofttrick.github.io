title: 'Disable Intel Turbo Boost to cool my laptop'

One of the most frustrating points of owning Intel laptops, or any laptops, is dealing with
heat issues. It usually stems from overclocking by the CPU. It's because of 
[Intel Turbo Boost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost). It's a frequency scaler that can
change a CPU's frequency to go higher than base clock depending on workload. That's why when you 
search for a CPU, there are 2 frequencies, Base Frequency and Turbo Frequency. The Turbo Frequency
is for 1-core boost, multi-core boost is in lower frequency.

It makes sense on a desktop because we're not limited by battery life or thermal. But when you're on
a laptop, those are the main concern. And a laptop when boosting up, has a tendency to overheat, bad!
I have seen it reached 99 degree Celsius, even shutting down. So I have an aversion toward using 
Turbo Boost in a laptop and try turning it off. Several steps have been taken to disable it.

#### Disable SpeedStep
This was my first method with my first laptop. However, it not only disabled the overclock, but also
disable frequency scaling completely, which was not ideal but I didn't know at the time. Dynamic frequency
scaling helps regulate power usage and thermal.

#### The 99%
My family had a convertible laptop with an [i5-7200U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/95443/intel-core-i5-7200u-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3-10-ghz.html). It was slow, ran hot as hell, small screen (13 inch) 
and expensive (800USD compared to 500 USD for a normal one). A way to deal with the heat was to go to **Power Options**
in Control Panel of Windows, click on *Change plan settings* of the current power plan, *Change advanced power settings*.
Afterward, scroll down to *Processor Power Management*. At *Maximum processor state*, fix On battery (and maybe
Plugged in) to **99%**. One downside is that you won't be accessing 100% of the CPU power. There is another way involving
[ThrottleStop](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/) but I've never looked into it.

#### Disable Intel Turbo Boost [(Linux only)](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=355295)
This one was both hard and easy. Hard for anyone not understanding Linux. Easy because I think the way to do it is.
Use **Terminal** and type:
```
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
```
This willturn off Intel Turbo Boost, *for now*. The next time you reboot, it resets to 0. To keep it
last, put it in a file, chmod +x *that file* and put in  a cron job for every startup like
```
@reboot home/user/noturbo
```
or create an (*udev* rule)[https://superuser.com/questions/1417292/udev-rule-to-start-a-command-on-ac-battery-plug-unplug-event]
if you want *plugged in* to have a different behavior to *battery*:
```
# Rule for when switching to battery
SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply",ENV{POWER_SUPPLY_ONLINE}=="0",RUN+="/home/user/noturbo"

# Rule for when switching to powersupply
SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply",ENV{POWER_SUPPLY_ONLINE}=="1",RUN+="/home/user/noturbo"
```
