I always want to have a virtualization lab in my home. But I don't want my server to fully commit to that idea.
Even though Proxmox seems like a decent OS for the job, I still pick Debian for more customization. It's more
general-purpose compared to dedicated OS. There's only one package that can help me realize the dream, *Cockpit*.

[Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) is a web interface for managing a server. It comes with many plugins that can be 
installed separately. I planned to use this for managing virtual machines, because this is the only application
with a UI to do so.

#### Installing
Quite easy if you're on Debian or Ubuntu. Just type
```
sudo apt install cockpit cockpit-machines
```
It will automatically install *Cockpit* along with VM plugin and other dependencies.

#### Quick look
Access the Cockpit UI through address [https://your.ip:9090/](https://your.ip:9090/). Your username and password
is your current account.

When you first log in, the account will be assigned *Limited access*, meaning it does not have *sudo* access.
You need to [escalate](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/privileges.html) to *Administrative access*
if you want more functionalities.
