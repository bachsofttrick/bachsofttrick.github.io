title: 'Cross compiling driver for Raspberry Pi'

After multiple times compiling drivers on multiple environments,
specifically OpenWrt, I'd decided to see if I could compile the driver
of my wifi adapter, [rtl8821cu](https://github.com/brektrou/rtl8821CU), for my
Raspberry Pi 3 from my laptop. Raspberry Pi ran on DietPi, which is
based on Debian.

#### Compile on Raspberry Pi

First, I installed *raspberrypi-kernel-header*, which is a package
containing the kernel source of Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, I ran this
command to compile the driver, it worked:

*make -j4*

I tried out this trick I learned from r8152 source compiling, but it
failed:

*make -C \<kernel source\> M=\$(pwd) -j\$(nproc)*

It didn't work when I added cross compiling parameters, either:

*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE= -C \<kernel source\> M=\$(pwd)
-j\$(nproc)*

#### Compile on x86

I downloaded the [Raspberry Pi Kernel Source
Code](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux) from Github and
installed the package gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu. I used the following line
but that didn't work:

*make -C \<kernel source\> M=\$(pwd) -j\$(nproc)*

So is the next one:

*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE= -C \<kernel source\> M=\$(pwd)
-j\$(nproc)*

After reading *Makefile* in the *rtl8821cu* folder and found a line at
the *modules* part:

*\$(MAKE) ARCH=\$(ARCH) CROSS\_COMPILE=\$(CROSS\_COMPILE) -C \$(KSRC)
M=\$(shell pwd) modules*

I rechecked my command line. While **ARCH, CROSS\_COMPILE** I filled in
correctly, I should be filling in **KSRC=\<kernel source\>** instead of
**-C \<kernel source\>**. It worked afterwards:

*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
KSRC=\~/Documents/Programming/linux-rpi-6.1.y/ -j\$(nproc)*

![make1](/images/230722/make1.jpg)

However, the output told me to go to the kernel source and run *make
oldconfig && make prepare*. So I did:

*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- oldconfig && make
ARCH=arm64 CROSS\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- prepare*

It asked a ton of questions though.

About to finish, it came out with this error.

I looked into line 2501 of Makefile of the driver, it was the *module*
part, so not the place yet. Line 1929 of Makefile of the kernel source
showed more promise.

I looked into *Makefile.modfinal*. It's like the file and the error are
both looking for *module.lds* but it's not available in the kernel
source. Temporarily, I copied *module.lds.S* to *module.lds.* It did
compile, but it didn't work on Raspberry Pi, likely because of kernel
6.1.21 currently on Pi, compared to kernel source 6.1.35.

#### What happened if you missed ARCH and CROSS\_COMPILE?

Missing **ARCH** came out with this error.

![missing arch](/images/230722/missing%20arch.jpg)

Missing **CROSS\_COMPILE** came out with this error.

![missing cross compile](/images/230722/missing%20cross%20compile.jpg)
**Conclusion**

So I guess for now I just compile the driver against the source on the
device then. Until I get the hang of cross-compiling.
