I just finished my 1-week job at a vet school. I was to guide and supervise the next generation of would-be veterinarians,let's call them "ensigns" like in TNG. They got to see if they cut out to be a vet. It was an easy gig. Free room, 3 meals a day, hot shower, laundry, a piano downstair. Few dollars to take home as payment. A few surprises, mostly happiness and fun. Most surprises came from me showing up at random times, helping out other staff with keeping an eye on things, or showing new attendees around. Everyone was really hardworking, attentive, more than I could. One moment stood out to me.

It was when we finished eating dinner, heading back to the dorm. But seeing that a lot of "ensigns" were bored, we decided to go to the football field. A lot of them played, some just enjoyed the scenery, the grass, the air. I was pleasantly surprised. Normally, I would have loved to spend time indoor, I thought everyone would just stick their heads to their phones. But that goes to show that life can still surprise you. Shows that there is still hope for the future.

They even made thank-you cards for every one of the staff. Which was considerate, heartwarming.
