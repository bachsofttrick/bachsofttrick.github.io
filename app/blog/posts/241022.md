These are the little tips I collected from reading various articles online, the Rufus source code, [credit to Pete Batard](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus), and installing Windows 11 more times than I could count.
- Bypass Windows 11 minimum requirement:  
*HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\*  
Create LabConfig key. Go inside, create BypassTPMCheck, BypassSecureBootCheck, BypassRAMCheck, BypassCPUCheck
DWORD Value, set it to 1.
- Get local account during initial setup (only for Windows 11 Pro):  
Make sure to disconnect the machine from Internet (hopefully there is no Wifi onboard or this won't work).
Press Shift + F10, type in Command Prompt *regedit*.  
*HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\OOBE\\*  
Create BypassNRO DWORD Value, set it to 1.
- Limit the amount of preinstalled apps when installing Windows 11:  
During setup on USB, select region as *English (World)*, **DO NOT SELECT English (United States)**.
