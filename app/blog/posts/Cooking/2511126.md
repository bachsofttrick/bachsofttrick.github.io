title: 'Trying frozen pizza'

I have tried frozen pizza before from Walmart. I remembered it was like 5 bucks. And it was super salty. I wondered if I threw at pizza away after first bite, or I tried to swallow the pizza because I'm a cheapskate.

Anyway, I am trying it again, this time 1.49-buck Roma pizza. It is a simple four-cheese pizza. I think
these frozen pizzas should be baked in a toaster oven instead of an air fryer, because an air fryer would dry the outer part of the pizza before it cooks the cheese.

This pizza baked pretty quickly, only took 10 minutes. And it tasted...alright. It was a thin curst, but I can clearly taste the tomato sauce. But only a hint of cheese, despite tons of cheese on top.
The best part is that the pizza *is not* salty like Domino's pizza. So that's a big win for me.
Maybe if I'm craving for a pizza, a frozen one might be the fix. I might try out the pizza dough 
next time, since I have a toaster oven.
