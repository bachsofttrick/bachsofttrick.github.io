I have tried frozen pizza before from Walmart. I remembered it was like 5 bucks. And it was super salty.
I wondered if I threw at pizza away after first bite, or I tried to swallow the pizza because I'm a cheapskate.
Anyway, I am trying it again, this time 1.49-buck Roma pizza. It is a simple four-cheese pizza. I think
these frozen pizzas should be baked in a toaster oven instead of an air fryer, because an air fryer would
dry the outer part of the pizza before it cooks the cheese.
