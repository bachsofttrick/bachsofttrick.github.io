This is an update on my journey towards understanding stainless steel pans.

I got myself a steel pan last week. It was on sale at Ross for 14 bucks. Can you believe it? 14 dollars for 10 inch
sauce pan. So I can fry, stir fry, make stew, soup. It's like a perfect well-rounded "potpan" I can use for anything.
This thing reminded me so much of the pot I used when I first got to the US. It was a big electric pot I used for 
everything as well. I was living in the dorm, so cooking was limited. And I couldn't go downstair to use the kitchen
because it was too far. So I used a big and a small electric pot for everything. That means the big one was also a pan.
I fried eggs in that. Because there were only two heat settings, I had to be careful to not burn the eggs. Was a fun
time, and really pushing my creativity in terms of storage, resource management and making use of what you have.

But I digress. I fried eggs yesterday by trying the old method. It was just medium temperature, adding oil in, and
frying the eggs. Granted, using this way, I had to baby the eggs to make sure they don't stick and burn. And they get 
burned easily. But I still managed to make it look good.

I guess I need some more practice, more understanding. Cause the Leidenfrost trick is not working for me.
