I have been eating a lot of Panda Express for lunch because it's cheap. $10, 1 chicken breast, 1 something saucy,
rice, vegetables. I also enjoy the Beijing beef and Orange chicken. But now I found a few references on how they
are made. It's literally "battered chicken in sugar sauce", so is the beef dish. But I do like their idea of
cutting AGAINST the grain, using a bit of baking soda for tenderness, using cornstarch (and maybe egg whites, too)
to prevent the meat from drying out in high-heat cooking. I also learned to utilize some vinegar for citrusy
flavor, because as I learned from [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/@ChineseCookingDemystified)
and looking at a lot of sauce bottles, they all shared a lot of common ingredients: water, sugar for sweetness,
white vinegar for sourness, flavor (some fruit extract, tomato paste, oyster extract), salt (or soy sauce if Chinese
sauce), thickener (corn starch, xanthan gum).
