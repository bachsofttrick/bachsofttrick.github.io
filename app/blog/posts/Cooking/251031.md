I have been thinking. Let's say there are chicken drumsticks:
- If I marinate an entire drumstick, it will only penetrate the outer layer of the meat. The inside would still be
normal chicken flavor, unsalted.
- If I cut the drumsticks to many small pieces, the marinate can go through. But that is a lot of work, and not
easy to store in frozen bags. I usually store the drumsticks in whole, at least they stick as drumsticks, easy
to defrost later. If I store a bag of chicken pieces, they will clump together, making them hard to defrost,
especially in microwave as they can be cooked through before defrost.

So I came up with an idea. Studying Chinese cooking techniques, I saw that they cook meat, vegetables, anything
that takes a while to cook first. Then those are put aside to make the sauce. So I did just that. I cooked the meat
first, whether is cut or whole, in an air fryer. Separately, on the stovetop, I heated up a pan, made a sauce
out of oyster sauce, some chilli and paprika. Then I **basted** the sauce on top of cooked meat, as in putting
the meat in the pan, pouring the cooked sauce on with a spoon. This is like basting a steak. Then meat went back to the air fryer to finish cooking. Voila, no different than cooking everything on a pan. What's more, cooking in an air fryer feels less oily on food, food is less dried I think.

So give it a try.
