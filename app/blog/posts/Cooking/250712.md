title: 'How does a 1000W portable burner beat a $600 electric range'

As I lived in the US for a while, I noticed that people cook using electric stove. It is not much different from back home.
My family switched to electric a while back, because somehow it cooks faster. But something I realized a while back, only
made clearer recently. As I got my hands on a portable hot place of 1000W, I compared cooking my food using the range vs
the hob. And somehow the hob won, even though the electric stove was supposed to have much more [power](https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-ENERGY-STAR-30-Free-Standing-Electric-Range-JBS360RTSS). It was 1000W vs 1250W and 2400W.
Then how come a hob can make 1L of soup in 3 minutes, while it took 10 minutes to do the same on the small burner of 
the big stove.

Looking at the specification of the stove, I noticed these words. Sensi-temp technology, Temp Limiting Coil. Turns out
the electric stove has these sensors in the middle of the burner to detect when a pan or pot is overheat. Main problem
is, as a LOT of people have brought up from (this post)[https://old.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/bbgmi2/sensi_temp_coil_burner_is_messing_with_my_cooking/] and (this video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84pYbdTi_IE],
it causes the burner to not work as well as intended. Food not getting hot fast enough, burner still causes danger
WHEN THERE IS NO POT on top. It got to the point where a mini hob of 1000 watts can beat it in its own game.

This is a function designed for people who either don't know how to cook, or careless when cooking to the point 
of leaving the burner running while distracting. Cater to the lowest denominator. This just ends up frustrating
actual cooks everywhere because of idiots ruining it for everybody.
