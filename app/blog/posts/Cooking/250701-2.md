Today I'm attempting to cook rice "again" in a pot. The last time I tried this, it was mushy, sticky, impossible to clean
out of a nonstick pot (by the way, I realized slowly that nonstick pot is a stupid idea. Best setup is nonstick pan/ steel pot).
This time, I got a brand new idea. Most likely recycling from how rice cooker cooks rice. So a rice cooker cooks rice at a
constant heat source. For my Aroma rice cooker, it was 300 watts. So I tried cooking the rice at level 3 of my stove in
the apartment, because in an experiment I did earlier, level 3 was comparable to my rice cooker when both were boiling
water. After 25 minutes (cause the stove had to heat up a bit), it was done. I tasted some and it was a bit mushy, but
overall, solid. It was better than my previous attempt with the cooking method of the Internet: boil then steam at low
burner level.

With maybe less water, this could work. Of course, I could try with either boiling water, or doing a hybrid: boil, then smaller at level 3, so it boils off the water AND the rice absorps some of it. 

The pot is still a pain to clean, though. Maybe soaking it with warm water for a bit is better.

The second time I tried today, I cooked it with level 4 burner. I cooked the rice in 20 minutes, then let it sit
for 5 more minutes. The rice came out almost perfect, just a tad mushy, I guess need less water. But there was a
sense that it was a tad dry, not fully cooked. Maybe just my feeling, but a bit more water, 5 more minutes in heat
would have helped.
