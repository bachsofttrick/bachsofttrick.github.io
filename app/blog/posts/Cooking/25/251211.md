There is an advantage to living alone. I don't have to cook for anyone else to I can test new skill, new
recipe. But it is sad that nobody gets to enjoy my cooking.

Anyway, I have been doing a lot of frying. Pictured below are kimchi-jjigae, also known as kimchi
stew. I quite like the taste of kimchi, but it only serves as a flavor, not the main focus because
it's too salty and spicy. The first one, I fried some Spam and egg tofu. You have to try it, it's
delicious, fatty. But I had to use a nonstick pan because of the tofu. Fry the egg tofu long enough,
it became crunchy like an actual fried egg. Spam when fried gave out a savory, tasty new flavor.

The second one was the leftover stew with roasted drumsticks. I discovered that frying or roasting meat imparts that browned flavor to the protein, called the *Maillard reaction*. It tasted great, even as leftover. It's even better if you save some of the browned liquid from the roast for the soup.

This one was the Hamburg steak I fried with my stainless steel. Turns out 20% fat inside a beef patty
is quite a lot of fat, so I didn't really need a lot of oil. Taste like browned steak but juicier, not as
tough. With a meat thermometer, I didn't have to worry about meat not cooking through, so I cooked it for
10 minutes at medium-low temperature.
