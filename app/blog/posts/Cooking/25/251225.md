It's something I learned while researching my friend's luxury rice cooker. It was a 
[Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker](https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NS-ZCC10-Uncooked-Premium-1-0-Liter/dp/B00007J5U7). He got it cheap, I think
about 100 dollars. But it always makes perfect rice, similar to the one rice cooker
I got back home. I only got a 20-dollar Aroma rice cooker so I adapted a recipe found
online. The way the cheap rice cooker emulates cooking good rice is as follows:
- Rice (after having washed off the starch) will be sitting in water for 15 minutes.
- Afterwards, it will be cooked for 20-25 minutes. This is the part where *you plug in the cooker*.
- Profit.

All these steps are automatic in the expensive rice cooker. Plus, temperature is adjusted according
to a sensor to make the best cooked rice. But through these three steps, I can come close to it
with just a cheap one.
