Yesterday I was at Grocery Outlets. And catching my eyes was sets of vegan cheese. Now I am a cheese enthusiast myself,
but I have been having difficulty eating cheese, or milk, only yogurt. So vegan cheese sounds interesting enough to try.
Also because I watched a documentary in the past about this kind of cheese.

I bought a slice of Brie "cheese" by [Nuts for Cheese](https://nutsforcheese.com/pages/about-us). Pricing of 4.99 dollars for a 120g piece, this cheese was twice as expensive as a President Brie wheel of over 200g. First look was that the paper box was quite catchy and nice.

Opening it up showed us that piece of cheese. Unlike a real piece of Brie, it did not have a rind and a middle creamy
cheese. Instead, it was a uniform gray cheese. Slicing a piece for testing, it tasted tangy, salty, had a hint of cheese
and fermentation smell. So of course it tasted nothing like Brie, it was more "Cheddar" clone because of how salty it is.
I guess the salt is to cover up the fact this is not a cheese. I tried various vegetarian dishes in the past. A lot
of those used lots of salt and spices to cover up the vegetable flavor, too. I would appreciate it if they just not
add so much salt.

Coming to the US, I realized there is a market for vegan dairy product like cheese. But most of them used modified food
starch and chemicals, so this is a step in the right direction. It has less chemicals, bit more natural. But too pricey
and too salty for my taste.

Better luck next time, then.
