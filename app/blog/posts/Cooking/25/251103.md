I have been using a silicone spatula as a challenge for my frying pan. Normally when I cook, I use a stainless
spatula, because stainless steel pans can generally take a beating. That is why we bought them. But I figured,
using a silicone one is harder. There is no way to scrape hard bits off the pan, because the silicone is
elastic, not hard like metal. So it will take a skillful pan user to use this new spatula as a scraper of
fond. After a couple of tries, I did it. I used this to fold eggs, stir fry meat, scrape fond of the bottom
of the pan easily. It's just in the heat, that's all. Nowadays, I use the silicone spatula extensively
because it is much easier to clean than the stainless steel, which food tends to stick, or wood, which
leaves smell and oil in wood fiber and is hard to clean.
