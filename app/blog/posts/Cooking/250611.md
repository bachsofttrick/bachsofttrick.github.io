I have done a lot of cooking for a decade now. And recently, I have been trying effortlessly to make stainless steel
pan (cháº£o inox) work with my egg, i.e. not making eggs stick on my steel pan.

I keep hearing about the Leidenfrost effect. It is characterized by having water contain itself in a form of bubbles
when the pan is heated to 400 degree Farenheit. But my stove takes a long time to heat up. It takes 5 minutes for the Leidenfrost effect to show up when heating up at medium or medium-low temp. And even then, I'm not sure it was that effect since water formed little bubbles and some fizzled out. Even after applying oil, reducing the temperature to low, adding
an egg in and it would stick. It was hard to pry it off the surface of the pan.

So I give up on eggs. They do make nice, crunchy steak, so at least there are some benefits to having a stainless steel
pan.
