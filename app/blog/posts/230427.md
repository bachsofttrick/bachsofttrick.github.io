title: 'Data plan investigation: Zero-rating'

I have a curious habit. When checking out the best deals from my
country's cell companies, I searched Google for illegitimate websites
instead of going straight to the sources. They have a tendency to hide
their promotional data plans deep within the Internet, and only show
standard data plans on their websites. I came across a few ones that
caught my attention. They all had something to do with free data under
selected services:

\- YT30 from Viettel allowed you to watch Youtube videos and didn't
count towards your data caps

\- Big50Y from Vinaphone allowed watching Youtube, Tiktok, using Zalo
apps not counting towards caps and gave you 5 GB per day

\- Y60, our subject of investigation today, allowed the same things and
gave you 2GB per day.They came with a requirement of the promotion only
applies to the Youtube, Tiktok apps.

So I plan to investigate whether it could be applied to the website, and
could it be used on a laptop when tethered to.

#### Preparation

When I tried to register Y60 data plan on my Mobifone, I did not qualify
for it because it required that I was born before 1995. But I was able
to register for **G1** data plan, which included free data for the
following apps: Instagram, ZingTv, Zing MP3, Gmail, Google Drive, Zalo,
Viber, Tiktok, FPT Play. I also found another SIM on Vinaphone to
register **GT1** data plan, which included free data for Youtube, VieOn,
Nhaccuatui, Tiktok.

For Mobifone, they required you to install an app called mobifoneGo.
This app would tell you when an app launched is permitted for free data.
In addition, it also allows you to buy extra data plans for specific
apps you want free.

#### Result

According to my findings, mobifoneGo created a VPN that only tunneled
traffic through if it was coming from the selected apps. For example, I
used FPT Play to watch some TV using 4G. When I activated 4G, a VPN
tunnel was opened and when FPT Play was opened, the program showed a
notification stating that I had obtained unlimited data and using FPT
Play didn't reduce my data cap. If it had been any other apps, it
wouldn't have worked and my data cap would be decreased. I tried
broadcasting Wifi to my laptop to see if [https://fptplay.vn/](https://fptplay.vn/) counted
as free data but it didn't work, not even creating a proxy using Every
Proxy to go through the VPN tunnel on the phone solved it. It reduced my
data cap. The desktop-sized picture is when I ran out of my data cap.

For Vinaphone, it was simpler. You would get free data by either visit
the website like [https://youtube.com/](https://youtube.com/), [https://tiktok.com/](https://tiktok.com/),
[https://vieon.vn/](https://vieon.vn/), or use the equivalent apps. However, only Youtube
got free data, the rest didn't get free data, it subtracted my data cap.
I see a false advertising here!

#### Routing table in Android from Mobifone

Utilizing Termux, which is a terminal for Android, I looked for some
information regarding the tunnel.

*ip route show table 0*

\- With mobifoneGo:

*default dev tun0 table tun0 proto static scope link*

*10.0.0.2 dev tun0 table tun0 proto static scope link*

*default dev dummy0 table dummy0 proto static scope link*

*default via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\_usb0 table rmnet\_usb0 proto

*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\_usb0 table rmnet\_usb0 proto static scope

*10.53.120.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*

*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\_usb0 proto kernel scope link src
10.100.58.146*

*local 10.0.0.2 dev tun0 table local proto kernel scope host src
10.0.0.2*

*broadcast 10.100.58.144 dev rmnet\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope
link src 10.100.58.146*

*local 10.100.58.146 dev rmnet\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope host
src 10.100.58.146*

*broadcast 10.100.58.147 dev rmnet\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope
link src 10.100.58.146*

*\[\...\]*

\- Without mobifoneGo:

*default dev dummy0 table dummy0 proto static scope link*

*default via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\_usb0 table rmnet\_usb0 proto
static*

*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\_usb0 table rmnet\_usb0 proto static scope
link*

*10.51.40.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*

*10.53.120.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*

*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\_usb0 proto kernel scope link src
10.100.58.146*

*broadcast 10.100.58.144 dev rmnet\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope
link src 10.100.58.146*

*local 10.100.58.146 dev rmnet\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope host
src 10.100.58.146*

*broadcast 10.100.58.147 dev rmnet\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope
link src 10.100.58.146*

*\[\...\]*

As you can see, the 4G modem is *rmnet\_usb0*, the tunnel is *tun0.*
*tun0* didn't add any new route into the routing table, so I guess this
is a local VPN that changes the IP header from packets belonging to the
allowed apps so that Mobifone server can detect some kind of free data
flag, because it's unlikely for it to tamper with the original content
of a packet, which was usually encrypted by protocols like HTTPS in APIs
or video streams.

There isn't much change in the way a packet traveled through 4G either
way.

#### How Vinaphone found out about my free data

As most traffic is end-to-end encrypted by HTTPS, the only way I see
Vinaphone detect the free data is through reading the destination of a
packet being sent. They have a IP whitelist for the free-data plan. For
example, Youtube had the following IP list when I queried it using my
DNS Server:

*;; ANSWER SECTION:*

*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.136*

*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.93*

*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.91*

*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.190*

So it's likely Vinaphone allowed these IPs to not reduce my data cap
when I watched videos on them. It worked even when I tethered the phone
to my laptop to access Youtube on the web browser.

#### Zero-rating and net neutrality

Basically, when you use Internet on your phone through technologies like
3G, 4G, LTE, you have a data plan ahead with some limit on how much you
can consume. And some carriers sell special plans that allow you to
access some online services without reducing your data caps, usually
related to video streaming, communication\... That practice is known as
**zero-rating**. I got introduced to this concept by chance. First by
coming across BIG50Y data plan from Vinaphone, and the word came about
later when I was researching on this topic. This practice just showed up
in Vietnam recently, while had shown up in the US before. Like **Binge
On** from T-Mobile that doesn't reduce data cap when you watch videos on
Youtube, Netflix, HBO\... but how they go about doing it is [throttling
bandwidth of **any** videos regardless of
services](EFF Confirms: T-Mobileâ€™s Binge On Optimization is Just Throttling, Applies Indiscriminately to All Video).

Facebook also jumped on the zero-rating bandwagon with their own [Free
Basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet.org) (internet.org)
program, which granted you free access to Facebook (duh!) and other
services that had made deal with Facebook. It used to be deployed in
third world nations like India, Myanmar, but has since been removed.
Because it's a double-edged sword.

On the one hand, this exercise goes against net neutrality.

![](/images/blog/230427/facebook-freebasics-india-1100px.webp)

What is net neutrality you may ask? **Net neutrality** is the principle
that an ISP has to provide access to all sites, online services with the
same speed, same treatments without blocking, slowing down or give
"special treatment" to any others. It's the idea that governs free
Internet as we now know today. So **zero-rating** is essentially ISP
playing favorites to those paying to sponsor your data, whether is
content provider like Youtube, social media like Facebook, or both like
Tiktok. ISP can also play favorites to their own services. Why would you
want to watch live streaming on website A when service B, offered by the
ISP, charged nothing and reduced no data cap. Thus creating an unfair
advantage to anyone not willing to "pay-to-win", as the term from online
games goes. The consumers are disincentivized to explore alternative
sites, leaving "sponsored" sites the only choices they have, closing of
the Internet to a few sites. [There were surveys conducted in various
countries showed that people thought Facebook is the
Internet](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet).

Another problem arises is privacy and security concern over the practice
of checking packet (or packet inspection) to see whether it goes to the
zero-rated destination, or man-in-the-middle proxy to check its content
like Free Basics.

![](/images/blog/230427/free_basics_proxy.png)

The practice gives too much power to the ISP, who can now decide which
service providers it likes, which it doesn't and limit them.

An article on
[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/wtf-is-zero-rating/)
pointed out the logical fallacy I liked about zero-rating. Basically, if
you can infinitely watch video on their chosen platform, then there must
be enough bandwidth to handle it. If that were true, data caps wouldn't
be necessary at all. Which brings the whole zero-rating practice to
question.

There are, however, arguments to be made about the necessity of
zero-rating in very poor countries like
[Laos](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31463249), or continents [in
Africa](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/facebook-second-life-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-tech-company-in-africa).
Where there isn't enough money to eat, let alone spending it on data and
Internet, zero-rating at least gives people a chance to learn, a
platform for commerce, a tool for cheaper communication, however
limited. According to a Reddit comment about Free Basics, ["it does
include free access to Wikipedia as well as other sites like
Dictionary.com, a translator, BBC News, lots of Indian news sites,
WikiHow, Unicef and various other sources of health
information.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3z94u3/a_week_after_india_banned_it_facebooks_free/)
Depriving people of the Internet altogether means losing out on an
utility we all take for granted today. As a short term solution, it\'s
an unequivocal yes. There are an unbelievable number of African
businesses that exist only because of the [Facebook's Free
Basics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/facebook-second-life-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-tech-company-in-africa)
program. But calling it "Digital colonialism" is not fall from the
truth, as [Facebook became the Internet itself in the eyes of a majority
of
Africans](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/facebook-free-basics-internet-africa-mark-zuckerberg).
Hence why it was banned in India.

Another use case for the practice is free access to public service, such
as in medical, education, as pointed out by this [blog
post](https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/is-zero-rating-a-threat-to-human-rights).
The Colombian Government sanctioned zero-rated educational services so
that students wouldn't miss school during COVID pandemic. The Australian
and the UK partnered up with mobile carriers to curb misinformation
about public health, reduce cost barrier, achieve health equality. "Not
only did the service allow people to use online services to access
medical records, book appointments, and other services, but it also
enabled them to obtain information on several health topics".

#### Conclusion

After a lot of articles, researches on these topics, it's hard for me to
decide whether this should be acceptable. I'm pro net-neutrality. I'm
against the idea of a walled-garden for the Internet. But zero-rating
has its use, IMHO only for public services or disaster situation. It
shouldn't be used as a way to stifle competition.

#### Note: Fun fact about T-Mobile's Binge On

If you check out this
[article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies),
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) did an experiment to check if
T-Mobile throttled their downloads based on their contents and
protocols. From the result, it could be seen that they throttled
bandwidth **only** when they could **detect** the content type or file
type, which was only possible on HTTP because HTTPS encrypted data.
