title: 'How to clear "Recent Connections" auto-connect-profiles list in Blueman'

This is one of those shorter posts on my blog. Sometimes, you don't feel like 
talking a whole lot. You'll be seeing many more of these.

Anyway, this post today applies for Blueman, Bluetooth manager on my Linux OS, 
Lubuntu. I couldn't find how to remove an option from Recent Connections. That 
greyed out option kept me up at night, annoying me. I tried uninstalling Blueman, 
then reinstalled it. THe greyed out option was still there. So a quick bit of 
search led me to this [Github Issue](https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/issues/1450).

The issue said I had to run this command and it would clear all recent connection from the menu.
```
gsettings reset org.blueman.plugins.recentconns recent-connections
```
It did work. And now I'm writing this here to immortalize it.
