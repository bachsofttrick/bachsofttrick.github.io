title: 'Why does it take so long to delete in Lubuntu file explorer (PCManQt)'

I came across a [Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1fqa36v/why_is_rm_rfing_a_folder_over_thousands_of_times/) about deleting files taking so long on
Ubuntu file explorer, Nautilus. That got me thinking. This stuff happened on my Linux 
workstation all the time. Anytime I try deleting a folder with a lot of files,
this is what happens. I still want to see if it's true so I create a little experiment
according to the post.

#### The experiment
Using this command, the machine creates 30000 empty files in a folder of my choosing,
let's call it *delete*.
```
for name in $(seq 30000); do touch text$name.txt; done
```
Then I delete that folder using *Shift+delete* for permanent delete.
Same folder will be created again, but this time being deleted using the second way.
```
rm -rf delete/
```

#### Result and conclusion
For the first way on a file explorer, it took about 22 seconds.

The second way was much faster. Without using something like
```
time rm -rf delete/
```
you would think it's a blink of an eye.
They say this happens because the explorer spends time tracking progress, updating the UI, etc.
So maybe that's it.  
This also applies for copying, cutting too; network transfer on Samba/SMB and FTP. In fact, on my
home network, if I want to transfer multiple files fast, I usually use Filezilla instead, because despite
the inconvenience, it's faster than using a file explorer, and it's multi-connection so multi transfers.
