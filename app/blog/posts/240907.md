... the more they stay the same. Right now, it happens in web technologies. Back in the 
early days of the Internet, it was static HTML pages, sprinkle a bit of CSS and called it
a day. Then Javascript came along for more interactivity. People wanted more, so came PHP
for that dynamic web pages. PHP kickstarted the server-side rendering motive of web for years
to come. There was also ASPX. When I started working around 2020, it was the time of Javascript
frameworks. React, Vue, Svelte... you name it. Building Single Page Application was the bee's knee.
And then comes your NextJS, Nuxt, 11ty, Astro... Even PHP-based content management systems (CMS)
such as Wordpress have never left. It seems things a lot of times come full-circle, don't they?
It's like trends. Go out of fashion, then give it a decade, and it comes back. The 80s nostalgia
, big movie franchises, fat vs oil health debacle.
