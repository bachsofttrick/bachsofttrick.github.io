title: 'Sudo and SMB run slower after changing server name'

A week ago, I started transitioning from using my old laptop as a server to a brand new tower.
The old one worked fine, but it looked janky, hackney, unprofessional. Not too mention, it got
hit by my roomba all the time, disconnecting the hard drive connecting from a dock using a
USB cable. The new one has 4-core CPU i3-8100 instead of 2-core i3-4130U, and has a higher clock
too so it is faster. Other than that, it still runs Debian 12 like the last one.

However, I named the new one when installing *bach-server-2* instead of the old name, *bach-server*,
because at the time, I was moving back and forth between the two. Now that was finished, I renamed the new
one *bach-server*, but something happened. The SMB/Samba connection I used for file transfer seemed slower.
Any command run on sudo seemed sluggish, like the part where you enter the password showed up late.
And it turned out, according to this [post](https://serverfault.com/questions/38114/why-does-sudo-command-take-long-to-execute) from Server Fault, and [this] (https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/fedora-11-sudo-has-a-20-second-start-delay-732291/#post3575840) from Linux Questions,
it happens when I change the hostname like
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname bach-server
```
without changing the hostname in **/etc/hosts**, resulting in slowness.

So by changing the hostname, and the hostname in */etc/hosts*, everything works out again.
