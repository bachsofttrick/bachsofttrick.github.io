You wouldn't believe\njust how hard it was to get a job here. I not only had to compete with international\nstudents, but also native students here for just a job, not just tech-related jobs.\nOut of two dozens job I had applied, about seven are rejection letters, others I didn't\nreceive any replies. My first job was working at the Memorial Union as a food worker.\nWhile I enjoyed the work, I still preferred working with machines more than humans so\nalways looking forward to dish room duty, ironically. But currently, I am working as a\nWeb Content Assistant for the Outdoor School of OSU Extension Service. I am thankful for\nthe opportunity working manual labor job, though. It gives me more appreciation for the\npeople working these types of job, and how much they have to put up with.\n\nNow, why did I title this post **A different mindset**? Well, my job consists of moving\ncontents from the old web page, made in Umbraco, to the new site, made in Drupal. But I\nam not allowed to touch any codes. Like, I am told to make the new contents closest to the\nold ones' look under new guidelines of the new site. Knowing this made me realize what my\nemployer meant when they said I was overqualified for the job. So now I can't think of the\nweb in terms of codes, inner structures and workings of the site. Only its contents matter.\nDoesn't matter if they won't match design in the end, as long as they are brought over under\nnew design patterns. I do my job, afterward recap all I have done back to the project manager. We will have\nweekly meeting every Wednesday, same as my previous job. In fact, I was the one who brought\nup the weekly meeting idea, a thing I usually did in my developer routine.\n\nIt took some time getting used to this role. It's an odd feeling. Like, I used to be the one behind\nhow the web looked. I was both frontend and backend. The old job's page, I was the one to make\nchanges directly, with the full power of programming. And now, making web with *Legos*,\nbuttons and clicks. You want to add button, there's a button for that. You want three columns, *button*.\nI wasn't even allowed to touch *HTML mode* to align three buttons to be on the same row. I had to get creative with this limitation, and added an extra three-column row so they are aligned. I can only do this job similar\nto how most people running a website would do when they aren't as proficient in programming as I am.\n\nI could understand the reasoning behind this limited power. The design is decided by a higher power.\nSo it's wise not to mess with it too much. But hey, a tech job is a tech job. After so many rejections,\nI'm just happy to take whatever counts as computer job. And who knows? Doing this job well, I might be\nconsidered to be put on the Salesforce team, or become one of the developers. That is, if they still have\na slot. Working here means a foot in the door of tech employment here. One for my resume.\n\n*Life is good.*"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8:Tc07,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After not working for a while as a full stack developer, I got a new\njob. Now I\\'m about to be a web developer, again. This time, I will,\nalong with a team, manage a website running a content management system\n(CMS), Drupal. Since I have never dealt with CMS, or PHP, before, this\nis a new venture for me. In preparation for this new job, I have watched\ntutorials, reinstalled Docker and many containers, done some works.\nLet\\'s say I\\'m excited to come back to programming. I guess having a\njob does push you to be more motivated.\n\nDuring my preparation, my brain just wondered somewhere. I typed in\nGoogle \\\".net vs javascript\\\" and stumbled upon a post in\n[Reddit](https://www.blogger.com/). I discovered there is such a thing\nas NET Minimal API, similar to the one I deployed on my server as a\nmusic, file server over HTTP on ExpressJS a while ago. This got me\nthinking a bit so I searched \\\"NET Minimal API\\\" on Google and there was\na tutorial for minimal API with .NET by\n[Microsoft](https://www.blogger.com/). I was surprised.\n\nWhen I was still working as a Full Stack Developer for my old place, I\n**hated** their .NET Core codebase. Because at the time, I didn\\'t\nunderstand what MVC was for, and many more intricacies in the underlying\nstructure of their codebase. I often argued with their senior developer\nabout the necessity of such baggage like interface, dependency\ninjection. To this day, I still can\\'t see the reason. Maybe because\nI\\'m ignorant to them, or I don\\'t have the view of the bigger picture,\nas most my web applications are quite small, a simple ExpressJS with a\ncouple of APIs should do it. That\\'s why I was ecstatic when we move on\nto other backend frameworks. My favorite at the time was NestJS. It was\nbuilt upon ExpressJS, so right up my alley. And since a new codebase\nmeant moving on from legacy baggages, no more problems from .NET Core\nhaunting me. Another thing I hated was I couldn\\'t program the .NET\nserver on Linux, I could only use Windows with Visual Studio, a behemoth\nIDE that ate up all of 12GB ram whenever I wanted to debug the program.\nI could never find ways to debug on VS Code, better yet, create a new\n.NET Web API project. Now with the discovery of .NET\\'s command line,\nmaybe those could be done on Linux.\n\nBut that got me to reflect on myself. What if I had figured this out\nsooner, would I still hate .NET as much as I did before. Maybe I would\nhave enjoyed the framework, because the language C\\# syntax is much\nbetter than Java. I had difficulty working with LINQ before slowly it\nbecoming my favorite thing when dealing with array of objects. It has\ntwo ways of doing things: query-like SQL or method (callback). I used\nthe method way back then. My greatest achievement on LINQ was using that\nand my then-newfound knowledge of garbage collection to create about 10\nmillion records for a table on MySQL daily. That job used to belong to a\nMySQL stored procedure, which runs for hours. My new way took 5 minutes\nto run. I always wondered whether the result was correct every time it\nran but no one seemed to complain."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9:Tb0b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"To be honest, with all the claims from Microsoft that S Mode is supposed\nto represent performance and security, it is still Windows. Still heavy,\nsweating Windows that eats up 3 GB of RAM for lunch while offering less\nspeed than Ubuntu or Fedora, two of which only eat up half as much RAM.\nBut I can't deny the security aspect. Since you are only allowed to\ninstall applications from Microsoft Store, malware is less likely to\nenter your system. But the store is pretty lacking in terms of\napplications that you want to use in your everyday task. The part you'll\nprobably hate is that you're forced to use Edge as the web browser, and\nyou can't switch to a different search engine except Bing. Luckily, I\ngot around it using Alt+Home key shortcut with Google as the homepage.\nIf your laptop doesn't come preinstalled with Microsoft 365, you have to\nuse any number of subpar office suites on the store to compensate.\n\nYou can switch out of S Mode by asking Settings for it. I tend to do\nthat later, so I can rip any remaining bundlewares off my laptop,\nespecially McAfee. For now, using S Mode is like a dare for me, to me\nhow far I can stand it. It's quite good so far. I got Office\npreinstalled, Edge is alright, lighter than Firefox, can install\nextensions from either Edge or Chrome. When I need to connect to a Linux\nbox, there is a ssh client called PuTTY that somebody ported to the\nstore. No Visual Studio Code, so I settle for Code Writer on the store\nand use that Linux box to compile code for me. But my patience is\nrunning low.\n\n#### First time running Windows without using a Microsoft account\n\nNote: I tried this trick on Windows S Mode. This trick DOES NOT WORK ON\nS MODE, because Terminal, or Command Prompt doesn't work on S Mode.\n\nPress Shift+F10 while in the Out-Of-Box-Experience, the interface anyone\nwho first starts their laptop would see.

Then when the setup asks for an Internet\nconnection, click on *I don't have Internet* option.\n\nFor S Mode: you can enter no\\@thankyou.com as the username and a random\npassword, which causes the login to fail, allowing local account setup.\n\n#### Some tricks in Registry Editor to improve performance\n\nDisable Widgets, so that even with update, it will NEVER be turned on:  \n*HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\*  \nCreate Dsh key.

But Jeff Geerling, a Youtuber I\nfollow, posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NJ6V8i1Xd8)\nabout deploying your own VPN to access your server from a remote\nlocation, and I feel like I must write my own experience on the matter.\n\n#### The differences in my approach\n\nAccording to Mr. Geerling, he had a public IP (though not static) and\npointed his domain to this IP to connect to his network using Wireguard\ninstalled by PiVPN. I do not have such luxury, as my public IP is\n10.x.x.x through PPPoE to my ISP, Viettel, so using his way was out of\nthe question. I am stuck in a situation known as CGNAT. What's more, he\nexposed ALL his network out, which, to each of their own, is quite\ndangerous as the VPN can be used as an attack vector to your own\nnetwork. I did a similar thing while creating my own VOIP service using\nAsterisk, but it only lasted a day, and I quickly closed it due to the\ndanger behind it. PiVPN, the tool he used, is quite fascinating and I\nwill look into it in the future. But back when I built my VPN, it was on\na virtual server, and I built it manually. I didn't know any automated\ntool like his, I just followed some guides from DigitalOcean to set up\nWireguard, along with fail2ban, ssh. In fact, the reason I chose\nWireguard was that it was easier to set up. OpenVPN has a lot of moving\nparts needed to run, while Wireguard only requires a pair of keys.\nGranted, there are\n[scripts](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install) that help\ninstall OpenVPN, but the performance is OpenVPN's Achilles's heel. I\nonly have 1 vCPU, so performance is kind of a big deal. Lastly, his\nvideo mentioned \"a little extra security on public Wifi\" and \"bypass\ncontent restriction\". While my VPN can't bypass any content restriction,\nit can provide encryption for my traffic on public Wifi, in addition to\nproviding its own DNS server to speed up DNS query.\n\n#### CGNAT (carrier-grade network address translation)\n\nA blog [post](https://www.draytek.co.uk/information/blog/what-is-cgnat)\non Draytek explains this well, but to quote from a\n[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/hi2sde/i_just_learned_my_internet_connection_is_cgnat_is/)\ncomment as a short version: \"CGNAT means your ISP doesn\\'t have enough\npublic IPv4 addresses to assign one to each user. So they are\nessentially doing to you what your home router does to the Internet by\ngiving you a NAT\\'ed IP address. Yes, that means you can\\'t run your own\nservers or forward traffic at home\". My situation may not technically be\nCGNAT, could be simply double NAT from my end and my ISP's, because my\n\"public\" IP is not in the CGNAT address block, which is usually from\n100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255, is 10.x.x.x. I first noticed this\nphenomenon in 2014, when I installed fiber. Though back then I didn't\nknow how to bridge the ISP router to my TP-Link router, I knew of double\nNAT and opened similar port on both routers to torrent. However, I\nchecked on [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org/) and they couldn't see the open\nport. The torrent could still download, but it couldn't upload. It was\nstrange, because before that, I could see the open port when I was still\non ADSL (also double NAT). It was my biggest achievement back in 8^th^\ngrade, to open port and torrent, or host my own radio using Windows\nMedia Encoder. The second biggest was getting 3D games to run on my\nPentium 4 computer.\n\n#### Setting up virtual server\n\nThere are a lot of options when choosing a virtual server provider. I\nchose Viettel IDC because it was the closest to home, and I also use\ntheir fiber service. I bought 1 vCore with 1GB RAM, 20GB SSD, 300 Mbps\nunlimited bandwidth. I chose Ubuntu Server as the base OS, because I'm\nused to Debian-based OS. I guess the way to choose your preferences\nworks the same in other providers, whether AWS, GCP, Linode\\...\n\nSome steps I performed before setting up WIreguard:\n\n\\- Install ssh to have remote access, instead of using console from\nbrowser. Change ssh port, only allow access with key\n\n\\- Configure firewall using\n[ufw](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-20-04):\nDeny all incoming, allow ssh port, Wireguard port\n\n\\- Install\n[fail2ban](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-fail2ban-works-to-protect-services-on-a-linux-server)\nto limit amount of login attempts\n\n#### Setting up Wireguard\n\nI followed this\n[guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-wireguard-on-ubuntu-20-04)\non how to set up Wireguard Server. First, I generated 2 pairs of keys,\none for the server, one for the client using the commands:\n\n*wg genkey \\| sudo tee /etc/wireguard/private.key*\n\n*sudo cat /etc/wireguard/private.key \\| wg pubkey \\| sudo tee\n/etc/wireguard/public.key*\n\nFollowing that, I had to choose a subnet. Since 192.168.0.x, 1.x are all\ntoo common, I chose anything from 2.x and up. After that, I went to\n*/etc/wireguard/*. I created a config file for my VPN, *wg0.conf*\n\n*\\[Interface\\]*\n\n*Address = 192.168.13.1/24*\n\n*PostUp = ufw allow 51820/udp*\n\n*PostUp = ufw route allow in on wg0*\n\n*PreDown = ufw delete allow 51820/udp*\n\n*PreDown = ufw route delete allow in on wg0*\n\n*ListenPort = 51820*\n\n*PrivateKey = \\\u003cserver private key here\\\u003e*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]*\n\n*PublicKey = \\\u003cclient public key here\\\u003e*\n\n*AllowedIPs = 192.168.13.2/32*\n\n*\\[Interface\\]* is configurations for your own VPN interface, whether\nit's a server or a client. *PostUp* and *PreDown* are commands to run\n*after* turning on the VPN server and *before*\nshutting down server, respectively. I set up a bunch of commands that\nopen port, allow traffic running inside VPN and vice versa when turning\noff server. *\\[Peer\\]* are configurations for clients that will connect\nto the server. Each *\\[Peer\\]* adds another client to the server.\n*AllowedIPs* is where you type in the client's VPN IP address. If the\nclient also acts as a router to another subnet, for instance,\n192.168.0.x, you can add *192.168.0.0/24* and you can access that subnet\nfrom the VPN.\n\nOn my home server, not the virtual one. I also created a config file in\n*/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf*:\n\n*\\[Interface\\]*\n\n*PrivateKey = \\\u003cclient private key here\\\u003e*\n\n*Address = 192.168.13.2/24*\n\n*DNS = 8.8.8.8*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]*\n\n*PublicKey = \\\u003cserver public key here\\\u003e*\n\n*AllowedIPs = 192.168.13.0/24*\n\n*Endpoint = \\\u003cserver real IP\\\u003e:51820*\n\n*PersistentKeepalive = 25*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]* here means something different. For a client to connect to a\nserver, it only needs 1 peer. For *Endpoint*, you need to pinpoint the\nvirtual server's IP address. *PersistentKeepalive* is necessary to keep\nthe connection up, as we are running essentially a tunnel from the\nvirtual server to the real one. If the client isn't a server, that part\nwon't be needed.\n\nOn both servers, I typed in *wg-quick up wg0*. I pinged from each side\nwith the other's IP address and it worked.\n\n![](/images/blog/240902-1/wireguard_8070_8878.png)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Jeef Geerling - Build your own private WireGuard VPN with\nPiVPN](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/build-your-own-private-wireguard-vpn-pivpn)\n\n\\- [Information about icanhazip.com, you can use ident.me\ninstead](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/06/17/how-a-small-free-ip-tool-survived/)\n\n\\- [ELI5: How does NAT (Network Address Translation)\nwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1wqc30/eli5_how_does_nat_network_address_translation_work/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"b:T189e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"It's very nice to have something powerful in a compact form, like a\ngaming laptop, when your job requires a heavy workload. But when your\njob requires you constantly in a meeting, only doing spreadsheets on a\nday-to-day basis, or if you are a student, sitting at lectures on end,\nthen a gaming laptop may not be for you because its battery life is\nhorrible. I mean, 3-4 hours is nice, only if you do not run any heavy\nworkload, or else it will drop to 1-1.5 hours. That's why I'm searching\nfor this *elusive* 8-hour battery laptop. I asked about it in a local\nelectronic retail store. They said it doesn't exist, only about 6 hours\nor so. Not planning to give up, I scoured the Internet to find something\nlike that.\n\n#### Low-powered solutions\n\nI came up with some solutions:\n\n\\- A laptop with a low-powered x86 CPU: like Atom (N3350, N4000, N5000,\nN4020, N5100, N6000), or m-series (m3)\n\n\\- A laptop with an ARM CPU: from MediaTek (MT8183, ...) or Qualcomm\n(7c, 7c gen 2, SQx family)\n\nAnother consideration is the operating system (OS) running on the\nlaptop. It's more important on ARM laptops because MediaTek CPUs are\nonly on ChromeOS, while Qualcomm ones are available on either ChromeOS\nor Windows. But using an ARM laptop is quite limited, especially on\nWindows, as you are constricted by the number of applications written\nfor the architecture. It's quite small. While battery life on ARM\nlaptops is vastly superior to that of x86 laptops, it doesn't matter if\nthere isn't any app for them. So, I leaned towards x86 ones. And today,\nI got a chance to try out a Chromebook.\n\nThis article is written using that same Chromebook, on Microsoft 365,\nbecause I'm more used to Office than Google Docs.\n\n#### What is Chromebook?\n\nChromebook, simply put, is a laptop with ChromeOS as the default OS.\nUnlike most OSes, it only works when connected to the Internet, even\nthough Google is trying to rectify that by allowing Android apps and\nLinux apps to be installed. The focus of the entire OS is the web\nbrowser, Chrome, which powers the OS as well. With the web browser, you\ncan, of course, browse the web. You can also install and run web apps. A\nChromebook utilizes its own cloud solution for most tasks, like office\nwith Google Docs, file storage with Google Drive (there is an internal\nstorage with a file manager). ChromeOS was built loosely on Gentoo\nLinux. I said *loosely*, because there isn't much Linux inside ChromeOS.\nMost commands are removed by Google. As the purpose of this OS is for\nweb browsing only, it's very light, and can run on some of the weakest\nhardware, say Celeron or Pentium, or cheap ARM cores. Although compared\nto Linux, not lighter by much. But much lighter than Windows by 3 GB of\nRAM.\n\n![](/images/blog/231011/top.png)\n\n![](/images/blog/231011/System_rest.png)\n\n#### My thought on Chromebook\n\nThe one I borrowed was a [HP\nChromebook](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-Chromebook-13-G1-Core-m3.215846.0.html)\nrunning [Intel Core\nm3-6y30](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/88198/intel-core-m36y30-processor-4m-cache-up-to-2-20-ghz.html)\nand 4 GB of RAM. It came out in 2016-2017 so it is quite old already. So\nmy experience will revolve around this one.\n\n\\- Keyboard lacking some keys for text editing: Home, End, Page Up /\nDown, no Function keys. Start (Super on Linux) key is gone, replaced\nwith Search key which replaces the Caps Lock for no reason. Why not just\nreplace the Start key and leave the Caps Lock alone? Those missing keys\nhave been replaced by shortcuts found by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+/** on the\nkeyboard to show off the shortcut list\n\n\\- Ran surprisingly fast on only 4GB of RAM. Could be because this\nmachine has the Android portion disabled by the organization I borrowed\nfrom\n\n\\- It's quite warm on the underside when working hard because there's no\ncooling fan (these low-powered chips don't usually have fans), but most\nof the time it's cool\n\n\\- Battery lasted about 6-7 hours, much longer than my gaming laptop. If\nrunning a heavy webpage, I think it could run for 2-3 hours\n\n\\- Lightweight. You can carry it with you like a tablet. But the same\ncan be said for Windows laptops of the same specs. But they probably run\nmuch hotter due to being a heavier OS *compared to ChromeOS*\n\n![](/images/blog/231011//IMG_20230922_115538_030.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/231011/IMG_20230922_115555_363.jpg)\n\n\\- File manager is very basic. It's like they took the codebase of\nGoogle Drive and used it as basis for the file manager\n\n![](/images/blog/231011/filemanager.png)\n\n\\- There's a terminal but it's hidden. You can access it using\n**Ctrl+Alt+T**, just like in Linux (which is funny, ChromeOS is loosely\nbased on Gentoo Linux). But it's quite limited in command. Type\n**help\\_advanced** to show off all commands available on ChromeOS\n\n**-** Settings: When you pull the scrollbar, the menu heading doesn't\nfollow you, which is quite useless as the function of a heading should\nbe. To be fair, Windows's Settings flaw is when you return to the\nprevious page, it doesn't *automatically scroll you to the previous\ncheckpoint*. **WHY IS IT so hard for them to design a decent Settings\napp??? They made it work ON ANDROID**\n\n**-** My Chromebook is old, so its GPU doesn't support the newest\ncodecs. Playing Youtube videos, if I leave it to run as is, the browser\ndefaults to VP9 and eats up 45% CPU. So I installed h264ify to switch\ncodec to H264 and pull the CPU usage down.\n\n![](/images/blog/231011/system_h264.png)\n\n\\- AUE: This is the biggest downside of using ChomeOS. There is an\nexpiry date, just like MacOS. When it hits the date, it won't receive\nany more updates from Google, even the browser, as the browser is\n**coupled with the OS. Yes, very WISE DECISION.** May have been\ndeliberate for planned obsolescence. There was news regarding\n[separating the two\napart](https://chromeunboxed.com/chromeos-116-transition-lacros-chrome-browser-seamless/),\nbut it remains to be seen what Google is planning. Does it allow to\nupdate the browser indefinitely, or just a few versions apart from the\nOS? As for my Chromebook, the update is no more, as it is expired. Still\nusable, if you don't have any concern regarding security\n\nI will be on the lookout for any Windows laptop running this CPU or\nsimilar and compare their performance and battery life."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:T9d3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"For the longest time, I was scared of using UEFI on my PC. With the\nexception of my laptops, which force me to use UEFI though I disabled\nSecure Boot because it's a pain to deal with, I have been using CSM mode\n(compatibility mode) that simulates BIOS. Lately with a new hard drive\nto test various Linux OSes on, I've decided to reinstall Windows 10\ninside the PC on UEFI mode, so on the new Linux hard drive I can install\nmultiple OSes without having their bootloaders stepping on each other\nlike in the BIOS age.\n\n#### Howto\n\nI learned this from [this\narticle](https://askubuntu.com/questions/509423/which-commands-to-convert-a-ubuntu-bios-install-to-efi-uefi-without-boot-repair)\nin StackExchange. These steps apply too, I guess, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch,\nor anything using GRUB as bootloader. Tldr, we *chroot* into the root\ndirectory *of the OS you want to convert*, run some commands and GRUB is\nrestored.\n\nFirst, I checked to see whether the machine is on UEFI mode using this\ncommand:\n\n*\\[ -d /sys/firmware/efi \\] \u0026\u0026 echo UEFI \\|\\| echo BIOS*\n\nProceed if it says UEFI, otherwise go into the BIOS menu and change it.\n\nAfterward, I mapped some partitions into the root directory of the OS\nthat is on the way to be converted (supposed that *sda1* is the OS\npartition, *sda2* is the EFI system partition, */mnt* is where you want\nto chroot to, could be anywhere else):\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt*\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/efi*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /dev /mnt/dev*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /proc /mnt/proc*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /sys /mnt/sys*\n\n*sudo* mount *\\--bind /run /mnt/run*\n\nLater on, I loaded a module called *efivarfs* (UEFI Runtime Variables\nSupport) using *sudo modprobe efivarfs*. Then I went in using *sudo\nchroot /mnt*.\n\nNow, depend on the OS, say Ubuntu or Fedora, you use their respective\npackage manager. For my case, that was apt. So:\n\n*apt update \u0026\u0026 apt list grub\\**\n\nCheck for package *grub-efi* and *grub-efi-amd64*\n(*grub-efi-amd64-signed* if Secure Boot was enabled, I didn't try it).\nAnd then I went:\n\n*grub-install \\--target=x86\\_64-efi \\--efi-directory=/boot/efi\n\\--bootloader-id=ubuntu \\--recheck \\--no-floppy \\--debug*\n\nAlternatively, [this\narticle](https://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi)\nsuggests reinstalling *grub-efi*. This is how I recover GRUB on Fedora,\nsince *grub-install* didn't work.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [What exactly is the problem with\nUEFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/63azo4/eli5_what_exactly_is_the_problem_with_uefi_and/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d:T167b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"When I tried out a bunch of distros, Fedora was among the ones what\nweren't like the rest. Another was EndeavourOS, based on Arch Linux. A\nfew things I learned while using Fedora Workstation, which was using\nGNOME as its desktop environment (DE).\n\n#### Choice of desktop environment\n\nOf all the distros I tried, they all shared similar desktop\nenvironments. Some can have multiple distros, each made with a different\nDE:\n\n\\- GNOME: probably the most mature of all. It's fast, plenty of\nanimation, its design is quite professional. Except the concept is\ndifferent. It's thinking desktop in term of workspaces, so each\napplication gets their own desktop. There's no minimize button, no\nmaximize except double-clicking to do so. The Windows key (or Super key)\nbecomes a central key for most actions on the desktop. You use this to\nswitch back and forth between workspaces. GNOME takes 2^nd^ place in\nterms of memory consumption, close to KDE.\n\n\\- KDE: probably the one I liked the least. While quite polished like\nGNOME and Windows-like, it's a bit buggy, a bit too many customizations\nin Settings so quite cumbersome to use. It's also a bit laggy and heavy,\nheavier than GNOME. For Fedora cold boot, KDE desktop takes 1.5 GB RAM,\nwhile GNOME about 1.2 GB RAM. Small different but KDE is not as fast as\nGNOME.\n\n\\- Xfce: Lightweight, fast, comparable to LXQt so they both share the\nsame spot. I happen to like LXQt more due to being a Lubuntu user\ninstead of Xubuntu. The latter\n\n\\- MATE: If you enjoy the look of old GNOME from back in '09, then use\nMATE. Like Xfce and LXQt, quite light on the resource.\n\n\\- Cinnamon: Linux Mint's own implementation of GNOME, Windows-like,\nlight, fast. One of my favorite next to LXQt.\n\nNote that this is my opinion on these DEs as their original forms,\ninstead of the customized looks that can be made by other distros. See\n[Xero Linux](https://xerolinux.xyz/) for KDE or\n[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) for Xfce,\n[ZorinOS](https://zorin.com/) for GNOME, Xfce.\n\n#### Display Protocol\n\nAs of the time of writing, there exists two protocols: X11 and Wayland.\n[Wayland](https://dudemanguy.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-10-wayland-xorg/wayland-xorg.html)\nis still in development and supposed to supersede X11, which has existed\nsince [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System). I tried\nWayland out in GNOME on Fedora and here are a few things I found:\n\n\\- Firefox finally utilized Nvidia GPU for video decoding through\n[nvidia-vaapi-driver](https://github.com/elFarto/nvidia-vaapi-driver). I\ntried numerous times on Lubuntu, which uses X11, and it didn't work. I\ncan finally watch 4K content on YouTube, though Iwill probably disable\nAV1 playback on Firefox because my GPU doesn't support AV1 codec.\n\n\\- There's no fractional scaling on GNOME, AFAIK. There's only integer\nscaling (200%, \\...)\n\n\\- No custom resolution. I used that on Nvidia because they never\nsupport my resolution 1600x900, which is supported on Windows. It's only\navailable on X11.\n\n\\- Performance on [Cemu](http://cemu.info/) is noticeably slower on\nWayland than on X11. This is achieved using the Vulkan backend with GTX\n1060 and Ryzen 5 1600. It's also\n[darker](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/142s10n/is_nvida_making_cemu_darker_on_wayland/).\nThe advice on Reddit was to avoid Wayland for this application due to a\nmissing function in Vulkan.\n\n#### Package Management\n\nFedora includes GNOME software center for installing and updating apps\nas well as the OS. This is way easier, more intuitive, and has more apps\nthan using Discover, its equivalent on my Lubuntu or KDE-based distros.\n\nIf you are a hardcore and want to use the terminal then **dnf** is the\nequivalent of apt:\n\n\\- At every first run when you open the terminal, dnf caches the\nrepository's package list. It's quite annoying, slow (because I haven't\nfigured out how to change mirror but I digress). But anytime you need to\nremove a package, you don't have to *autoremove* all of its dependencies\nlike in Ubuntu, it will do it for you.\n\n#### Codec\n\nUnlike other distros, Fedora doesn't include the popular video codecs\nout-of-the-box: H264, H265 for instace. That puts a damper on the first\nimpression of anybody using Fedora. You won't be able to play any videos\nusing these codecs on the Video app (Totem) or Firefox without first\ninstalling OpenH264, and you can forget about watching H265. Lucky\nYouTube uses VP9, which is open-source so you can still watch it on\nFirefox. Installing my usual app for watching video with Nvidia Hardware\nDecoding, Celluloid, which uses\n[mpv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/xe0p52/psa_mpv_is_now_available_on_fedora_37/)\nand\n[ffmpeg](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/cant-install-codecs/73797/5)\nas backend, didn't play H264 using hardware decoding because the codec I\ninstalled didn't support it, and of course no H265. VLC, however,\nworked. It decoded H264, H265 normally. But that was because they used\ntheir own ffmpeg to do it. Using Celluloid on Flatpak, which is a\ncontainer format for storing applications, I was able to play videos\nusing hardware decoding. Celluloid on Flatpak packages its own\ndependencies, which means its own mpv and ffmpeg with support for\nhardware decoding.\n\n#### Fixing UEFI bootloader\n\nReinstall packages related to GRUB instead of running *grub-install\n--target=x86\\_64-efi* like in Ubuntu/Debian\n\n#### Microsoft Core Fonts (Arial, Times New Roman)\n\nThis one depends on preferences, but I installed these fonts so that I\ncan use the docs files exported from LibreOffice Writer on Microsoft\nWord. For Ubuntu/Debian, you can install the *ttf-mscorefonts-installer*\npackage. For Fedora, follow [this\nguide](https://mscorefonts2.sourceforge.net/) to install\n*msttcore-fonts*."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:T2ab4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I have just bought a couple of SSDs for cheap on Facebook. They were\ntaken from , I guess prebuilt computers that their owners want their\npreinstalled disk drives replaced. So I plan to try out a couple of\noperating systems (OS) bare metal instead of using virtual machines, so\nthat I can see how it feels.\n\n#### Windows 11\n\nThis is the first one I tried out. First off, I couldn't flash its ISO\nfile onto the USB on Linux. I guess Windows ISO are built different. So\nI used [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) from Windows to flash it. The\nprogram supports bypassing Windows 11's lousy requirements, which are\nTPM (Trusted Platform Module), Secure Boot, 4GB RAM minimum. While it's\namazing that they include those in Rufus, I didn't really need it as\nWindows 11 ISO I got was from undisclosed sources, they've already\nscrubbed off those requirements. While installing, when you get to the\nadding user screen, MAKE SURE not to connect to the Internet, if you\nwish not to login your Microsoft account and create a local account.\nAfter all installation steps, I started using Windows 11 and here is\nwhat I found:\n\n\\- Normal cold boot of Windows 11 took about 15 seconds, compared to\nWindows 10's 7 seconds. So it's slower, not a good start.\n\n\\- By default, the Start Menu is situated in the middle of the Taskbar.\nThat aggravated me, because for the last 30 years, Start Menu has always\nbeen on the left of the screen. That was the standard. And now they\ndecided to move it for poorly justified reasons.\n\n\\- Taskbar's right click menu misses a lot of the options found in\nWindows 10, especially Task Manager. Normally I hold Ctrl + Shift + Esc\nto open it, but it reminds people that it exists when they right-click\non the Taskbar.\n\n\\- Settings seems to have improved a lot after Windows 10, which has a\nlacking Settings app. However, it's still no substitution for Control\nPanel. I found myself still using it on Windows 10 and 11.\n\n\\- Right click menu is limited because menu was shorten with only few\nselections, copy, paste had turned into icons. I presumed this is for\ntouchscreen, but dang it I was on a desktop. I had to\n[hack](https://www.theverge.com/23707964/windows-11-regedit-registry-menu-how-to)\nit to restore the previous menu.\n\nIn short, I went back to Windows 10 after a day. But it's no use.\nWindows 11 will eventually become the OS I **have** to use when Windows\n10 is deprecated, much like Windows 7 before.\n\nThat was Windows 11 version 21H2. Things changed when I tried to give\nWindows 11 one more shot with 22H2. While right click menu is still\nlimited, they speed up the cold boot time to about Windows 10's time.\nTaskbar's right click menu finally got its Task Manager option back, and\nit's been redesigned to reflect the design of Windows 11. Using Windows\n11 felt a bit faster than Windows 10, especially the effects. I\ndiscovered that the Microsoft Store allows you to download apps without\nlogin into Microsoft account and I found Windows Subsystem for Linux and\nAndroid. The Android one was amazing. While YouTube didn't work, I was\nable to install\n[SmartTubeNext](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext) and played\nsome videos on it, fully hardware-accelerated. This is different than\nany emulator I have tried, which never had hardware acceleration. The\nLinux one is fine. I just don't see the appeal, beside using this when\ninstalling bare-metal or using VirtualBox is not an option. Keep in mind\nthat each subsystem **eats up about 2 GB of RAM**, so be mindful when\nusing them on anything less than **8 GB of RAM**.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/win11-taskmgr.png)\n\n#### Linux Mint\n\nI recently turned to Linux as a daily driver, after multiple incidents\nof Windows 10 on my laptop threatening me that it would update itself to\nWindows 11, and the button to skip it was a rather small one on the left\nof the screen, and you will definitely miss it, **as** Microsoft\ndesigned it so. I explored a couple of options in the Ubuntu ecosystem\nbefore settling for Lubuntu:\n\n\\- Ubuntu was a bit heavy, I wanted something leaner. Besides, when I\ntried to install it, I am stucked at partitioning. For whatever choice I\npicked, it wouldn't let me continue.\n\n\\- Xubuntu, though as light as Lubuntu with its Xfce desktop environment\ninstead of LxQt, is rather metallic in color and quite bright.\n\nUsing Lubuntu for a while, I decided to look into Linux Mint. Based on\nUbuntu, but without **Snap**, which is already a plus, it's regarded\nhighly within the Linux community for its simplicity, ease of use. Linux\nMint has a few flavors to choose:\n\n\\- Cinnamon, the team's own take on GNOME\n\n\\- MATE (read ma-te), continuation of GNOME 2\n\n\\- Xfce\n\nI chose Cinnamon, as that's the default of the OS. Here are my thought:\n\n\\- The design of the desktop is quite nice, due to it looking like\nWindows 10 but better.\n\n\\- Their Settings app works more like the Control Panel, where it's just\na collection of tools. It takes a bit getting used to, cause I'm used to\nLubuntu.\n\n\\- Most of the apps you use are available from the start, like Firefox,\noffice with LibreOffice, watch movies with Celluloid (mpv with\ninterface). However, if you wish to install more, there's a software\nmanager that you can run to install more. It works like an app store for\nyour PC.\n\n\\- Unlike Windows 10 and 11, I can choose whether to let it auto update\nor not, and update what packages. There's an app that takes care of\nthat, if not I can use **apt**.\n\nWith Ubuntu 24.04 slowly turning to force Snap as its app management to\nall users, kinda like Windows, people including me are considering\nmoving shops to Linux Mint because at least they have yet to sell like\ncorporate sellout.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/cinnamon.png)\n\n#### Elementary OS\n\nThis is another OS that is based on Ubuntu. Seems to be a running theme\nfor my choice of Oses. I guess because Ubuntu itself is popular and\nbeginner-friendly. Whenever Linux is mentioned to anybody, their first\nthoughts are Ubuntu and Debian. I began my journey to download the ISO\nfile.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/elementary.jpg)\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye is that they asked you to pay for the\nOS. I was planning to skip this OS when I tried typing zero into the\nprice and it allowed me to download again. Usually in other OSes, they\nask you before you download if you'd like to donate them some money.\nThis one essentially tricked you into thinking that you have to buy it.\nWell, maybe there's a reason for that. I installed the OS and ran it. It\nlooked very good. There have been works done to make Elementary OS look\nlike a beautiful piece of art. Quite like macOS except I liked this way\nmore. That is Pantheon desktop environment, by the way. Like Linux Mint,\nthey use software manager called AppCenter to manage all packages. But I\nhad to give this OS a pass. Because when I tried installing NVIDIA\ndriver on and restarted my PC, the desktop environment stopped showing,\nleaving the terminal behind. So there were some bugs or compatibility\nproblems with Pantheon. Maybe if I had an AMD GPU or using Intel CPU, I\ncould use it a bit longer. Shame!\n\n#### Pop OS\n\nWell, another derivative of Ubuntu developed by System76, a manufacture\nof desktops and laptops specifically for Linux. So unlike other Linux\ndistributions (or distros), this OS is not community-driven but\nmaintained by a company, so there is a degree of responsibility to\nensure their OS work perfectly on their products, and by association our\nown PCs. They use their own desktop environment, which is COSMIC, a\ncustomized GNOME. Well, not really heavily customized. I could point out\na few similarities between them. Downloading ISO was simple enough.\nThere was even a specialized version for Nvidia GPU, like in my desktop.\nStill, I tried the normal version and worked the way up. Unlike that\nbuggy Elementary OS, it actually ran after installing the GPU driver.\nThe distro was quite good even if I didn't spend as much time on it. I\nguess the experience is the same if you've used any other distros with\nGNOME desktop.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/Pop-OS-22.04-Desktop-beta.webp)\n\n#### Debian\n\nThe daddy of all distros based on it. This distro is recommended only\nfor server because of its stability, reliability. Part of it is because\nthe packages on this one are old, not as up-to-date in order to be\nstable. Unlike on my server which is running Debian 12 (bookworm), I've\ndecided to try the testing branch. And guess what, it was a bad idea.\nThe kernel update version 6.4 from the testing branch broke the OS. I\nhad to boot from an older one (5.10) to salvage it. I pulled the kernel\n6.1 from Debian 12 to run on my desktop and it worked. I installed KDE\nPlasma desktop environment, ran it in Wayland mode. (Wayland here is a\nwindow system protocol, like its predecessor, X11. Its job is to render\nwindows and any elements onscreen). And it **ran** like a turtle, CPU\nspiked to 400% on a Ryzen 5 1600 6-core. It wasn't until I installed the\nNvidia GPU driver that it got better. However, I didn't really like\nKDE's look. It's a bit rugged, square, even though I could say the same\nthing about Lubuntu's LXQt. But I did not like it. I know about GNOME\nand KDE are vastly customizable, and I would get to those one day, for\nnow it's just my first impression on the desktop environment. I later\ntried KDE on Fedora and also didn't like it, either. If you're\nacquainted with using Ubuntu, then Debian shouldn't be any different,\nsince Ubuntu derived from Debian.\n\n#### Fedora\n\nThere are so many things to say about this one that it deserves its own\narticle.\n\n#### EndeavourOS\n\nThis one is based on Arch Linux. Despite what everyone said about how\nhard it is to use it, there's even a meme \"I use Arch, btw\" meaning it's\na tough cookie to crack, I had fun with it. It's easy to use, its\npackage repository is packed with applications that have newest\nversions. Firefox is in it instead of in a container format like Snap on\nUbuntu or exists only as *firefox-esr* like Debian. It's not insane in\navoiding proprietary components at all cost like Fedora, to the\ndetriment of the usability of the OS. And it's a new kid in town, not\nsurrounded with dramas like\n[*Manjaro*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlD17OjFAc). It's only\ncrime is that its package manager,\n*p[acman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Rosetta)*, works a\nlittle different than the rest.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/Screenshot_endeavourOS.png)\n\n#### Zorin OS\n\nMuch like Linux Mint, it is based on Ubuntu and looks like Windows. It\ncomes with 2 flavors: Core in GNOME, Lite in Xfce.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/Zorin-OS-16.1-Core.png)\n#### Xero Linux\n\nBased on Arch Linux like EndeavourOS before it and also a new kid in\ntown. But while by default EndeavourOS uses Xfce, this one uses KDE\nPlasma as its beautifully crafted desktop environment, with a GNOME\ndashboard and a wobbly effect whenever I move the window.\n\n![](/images/blog/230823-1/xerolinux.webp)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"f:Tc24,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After multiple times compiling drivers on multiple environments,\nspecifically OpenWrt, I'd decided to see if I could compile the driver\nof my wifi adapter, [rtl8821cu](https://github.com/brektrou/rtl8821CU), for my\nRaspberry Pi 3 from my laptop. Raspberry Pi ran on DietPi, which is\nbased on Debian.\n\n#### Compile on Raspberry Pi\n\nFirst, I installed *raspberrypi-kernel-header*, which is a package\ncontaining the kernel source of Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, I ran this\ncommand to compile the driver, it worked:\n\n*make -j4*\n\nI tried out this trick I learned from r8152 source compiling, but it\nfailed:\n\n*make -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd) -j\\$(nproc)*\n\nIt didn't work when I added cross compiling parameters, either:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE= -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd)\n-j\\$(nproc)*\n\n#### Compile on x86\n\nI downloaded the [Raspberry Pi Kernel Source\nCode](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux) from Github and\ninstalled the package gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu. I used the following line\nbut that didn't work:\n\n*make -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd) -j\\$(nproc)*\n\nSo is the next one:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE= -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd)\n-j\\$(nproc)*\n\nAfter reading *Makefile* in the *rtl8821cu* folder and found a line at\nthe *modules* part:\n\n*\\$(MAKE) ARCH=\\$(ARCH) CROSS\\_COMPILE=\\$(CROSS\\_COMPILE) -C \\$(KSRC)\nM=\\$(shell pwd) modules*\n\nI rechecked my command line. While **ARCH, CROSS\\_COMPILE** I filled in\ncorrectly, I should be filling in **KSRC=\\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e** instead of\n**-C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e**. It worked afterwards:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-\nKSRC=\\~/Documents/Programming/linux-rpi-6.1.y/ -j\\$(nproc)*\n\n![](/images/blog/230722/make1.jpg)\n\nHowever, the output told me to go to the kernel source and run *make\noldconfig \u0026\u0026 make prepare*. So I did:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- oldconfig \u0026\u0026 make\nARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- prepare*\n\nIt asked a ton of questions though.\n\n![](/images/blog/230722/make%20oldconfig.jpg)\n\nAbout to finish, it came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/blog/230722/make2.jpg)\n\nI looked into line 2501 of Makefile of the driver, it was the *module*\npart, so not the place yet. Line 1929 of Makefile of the kernel source\nshowed more promise.\n\n![](/images/blog/230722/make3.jpg)\n\nI looked into *Makefile.modfinal*. It's like the file and the error are\nboth looking for *module.lds* but it's not available in the kernel\nsource. Temporarily, I copied *module.lds.S* to *module.lds.* It did\ncompile, but it didn't work on Raspberry Pi, likely because of kernel\n6.1.21 currently on Pi, compared to kernel source 6.1.35.\n\n#### What happened if you missed ARCH and CROSS\\_COMPILE?\n\nMissing **ARCH** came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/blog/230722/missing%20arch.jpg)\n\nMissing **CROSS\\_COMPILE** came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/blog/230722/missing%20cross%20compile.jpg)\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo I guess for now I just compile the driver against the source on the\ndevice then. Until I get the hang of cross-compiling.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1906131)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:Tcca,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I have recently become a permanent resident of the Linux land. I live in\nLubuntu town. That's a funny way to say that I use Lubuntu as my daily\ndriver on my laptop. On my laptop, which is an Intel i7 9750H + GTX 1060\ncombo, it's been kind to me and given me my preferred screen resolution,\nwhich was 1600x900 out of the box. That wasn't the case for my desktop,\nwhich is an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 + GTX 1060 combo, as it gave me its default\nresolution of 1920x1080. There's nothing wrong with it, other than the\nletters appear like tiny dots on screen. When I opened the Monitor\nSettings, it didn't give me 1600x900, instead there were 1920x0180,\n1680x1050, 1600x1200. Nvidia Settings certainly didn't help, it didn't\nhave 1600x900, either. So I had my work cut out for me.\n\n![](/images/blog/230721/nvidia.jpg)\n\n#### Finding answers in vain\n\nI first tried out [this\nmethod](https://itslinuxfoss.com/set-custom-resolution-using-xrandr/)\nto set a custom resolution. However, it returned this error and wouldn't\nallow me to add that resolution:\n\n*X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)*\n\n*Major opcode of failed request: 140 (RANDR)*\n\n*Minor opcode of failed request: 18 (RRAddOutputMode)*\n\nI searched everywhere for a solution to no avail. That means, while\nthere are answers, none satisfies what I'm looking for.. So I tried the\nnext method, setting it on Nvidia's side using Nvidia Settings.\nAccording to [this\npost](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=255287),\n*you want to do this by setting your ViewPortIn to your desired\nresolution, and your Panning to the desired resolution as well. Do NOT\ntouch ViewPortOut*.\n\n![](/images/blog/230721/lxqt-config-monitor.jpg)\n\nI applied it and saved the settings to X File. However it won't write\nthe X File **xorg.conf** down to */etc/X11/* so I have to issue a\ncommand [*sudo chmod u+x\n/usr/share/screen-resolution-extra/nvidia-polkit*](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/cant-save-to-x-configuration-file-on-nvidia-settings/185069)\nto make it work. After I'd done that, I logged out and back in.\nInterestingly, the login screen showed that the custom resolution\nworked, but as soon as I logged in*,* the screen *turned back to\n1920x1080* and Nvidia reported my screen resolution as Auto.\n\n#### Stumbled upon the solution\n\nAt that point, I was stump. Like what do I do now? I kept trying back\nand forth between two ways for hours. Nothing works. Until something\namazing happened. I read somewhere that after saving the settings on the\nNvidia's side, I should change the monitor settings from the OS side, so\nI switched it to 1680x1050, logged out, logged back in. And voila. It\nfinally clicked. I can't believe it. So I guess that's how it's done.\n\nAccording to the [official\nguide](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/persist-nvidia-x-server-settings/158102/5),\nthe desktop environment, in this case LXQt, may have overridden any\nconfiguration from nvidia-settings, hence why Lubuntu switched to\n1920x1080 after its login screen was 1600x900. The way I pulled it off\nseems like a hack, because it is. I'm supposed to either change\nresolution from the monitor settings within Lubuntu or disable any\nfeature for managing displays. But hey, as long as it works.\n\n![](/images/blog/230721/it_work.png)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T1600,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"If you have to do research on cell phones like I do, you'll eventually\nfind that any phone can have multiple models existing in the wild. For\neach market, say Asia, Japan, the US, China\\... they released a\ndifferent model. Most of the times, it supported different **frequency\nbands**, because some country like the US, Korea,\\... have **cell phone\nstandard** that separated them from the rest of the world. Other times,\nit was a model exclusive to a network, a company, an event. Today, I\nwanted to tell a couple of stories involving phone models catering to\ndifferent frequency bands.\n\n#### Oneplus One: Holy grail of phone design, price-performance ratio, practically useless as a phone\n\nThis was back in 2014. I just finished my university entrance test and\ngot into a major university in my city. So I was given fairly big budget\nto purchase my favorite thing. I chose to buy a smartphone. I was the\nfirst of my family to get a smartphone. However, this was for my\n*second* one. The first one I bought beforehand was a [Nokia\nLumia 820](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_820-4968.php). It was a\nWindows Phone, because my friend convinced me to the platform. It was\nnice and fast, but also lacking in applications. The phone in question,\nOneplus One, was pushed heavily in online marketing. There was an event\nback then which you typed in your email on their website and prayed to\nthe lucky star to get an *invite* to buy their phone\ninternationally. SO of course I didn't win.\n\n![](/images/blog/230707/OnePlus-Never-Settle.jpg)\n\nI later found a model that was selling at a nearby store. Costed about\nthe same as the one on their website, which was \\$350. To put it into\nperspective, a phone with a similar performance to Oneplus One was\ndouble the price. So you can see the value Oneplus offered. Anyway, I\nbought the phone. I inserted my SIM card in, not connected. I tried\nmultiple times, including restarting the phone, switch on and off\n*Airplane Mode*, change *Select Network* to *Manual*. I found out later\nthat **maybe** the model I bought was a Chinese one, not an\ninternational one, so the frequency bands might be different. Figured,\nsince there was only a limited number of the latter in the world due to\nthat event. I searched for ways to fix this. ROM hacks, firmware\nupdates, modem fix, \\... many ways. I tried them all. This was during\nthe era when custom ROMs, which were customized Android OSes, reigned\nsupreme, and was a way to boost a phone's performance because of early\n2010s' lackluster specs on smartphones. Nowadays, it's becoming harder\nsince phones have become cheaper, more capable, and more secure. Forums\nlike [XDA-Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/) were where I\nfrequented to find ways to fix the phone. At one point, I even stuck a\npaperclip in to try to fix the SIM card slot. Hilariously, the phone\nstore couldn't fix it. So I had to fix it by slowly pulling it out. I\nsuccessfully pulled it, but the phone still didn't work on my network.\nSo I was stuck with a Lumia and a 5.5-inch tablet. But at least it had a\nSnapdragon 801, a beast of an ARM CPU at the time. At least until I\nlater changed to Coolpad Note 3 Lite after I broke my Lumia 820. FYI,\nthe Coolpad phone was horrible and slow.\n\nSometime later, I pulled the Oneplus One out for my sister after\nretiring it long ago, gave it an update to Android 6 and **then** it can\naccept my SIM card, albeit only 3G was possible.\n\n**Oneplus Nord CE 2 Lite: How not paying attention to About Phone can\ncost you big time**\n\nJust last June, 2023. I planned to buy this phone in anticipation for my\ntravel to the US. I needed a phone that could use the US cellular\nnetwork without buying from the US, because I thought it would be\nexpensive. I checked the specs of the phone online, cross-compare to\nother phones of the brand. I was looking for headphone jack and\ndual-SIM, because I hate this trend of removing what should already be\npossible on thin phones. I checked out 8 Pro, 7 Pro, Nord N20 and found\nthis one fit, and somebody resold this used one for about 3.2 million\nVND. So I took the chance and bought it. After a few hours, I innocently\nsearched for the model, CPH2381, seems that there were 2 models of this\nphone. And I was hit with results from Amazon India and Indian phone\nstores. While the other model, CPH2409, was the international one.\n\n![](/images/blog/230707/cph2381.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/230707/cph2409.jpg)\n\nThen something clicked. On the page they advertised this used phone,\nthere was an image of the phone's About Phone page that said *model\nCPH2381*. So because of **one little mistake***,* I took home a phone\nthat will most likely be useless in the US, because it didn't support\nenough frequency bands from the US. And I can't take the phone back,\nbecause technically it still works here in Vietnam. So no dice. I ended\nup once again, gave this one to my sister so she could replace her aging\nSamsung Galaxy A7. There goes my birthday present.\n\n![](/images/blog/230707/OnePlus-Nord-CE-2-Lite-5G_FoneArena-11-1024x691.jpg)\n\n#### What we can take away for these stories\n\n\\- Probably pay more attention to the model if you are looking for a\nspecific phone, since it's so rare and hard to find.\n\n\\- Just to go the country you plan to go and buy the phone from there.\nBecause now I have to pay double for a phone in the US, half for the\nOneplus CE 2 Lite, half for whatever I will buy in the US to use.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Oneplus One\nSpecifications](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one-6327.php)\n\n\\- [OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G\nSpecifications](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_ce_2_lite_5g-11344.php)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"12:T2881,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I wrote a post on compiling OpenWrt from source a few months ago. Since\nthen, I've been playing around with its source, building new images with\nit to test on virtual machines. OpenWrt finally added [support for\nOrange Pi R1 Plus (LTS)](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/12818) for\ntheir next release, 23.05. And with a new driver for RTL8153, a chipset\nused in the board, I decided to go back to patching OpenWrt one more\ntime.\n\n#### Kernel patch\n\nAs shown from my previous post on OpenWrt for Orange Pi R1 Plus, kernel\npatches are how they affect the kernel to their preferences for running\nOpenWrt, like allowing unsupported devices to run the OS. The Linux\nkernel source has upstreamed dts for R1 Plus on v6.3 and LTS on v6.4,\nand now is *backported* to kernel 5.15 for OpenWrt 23.05 using kernel\npatches. Patches are created using either *diff* or *git diff*.\n\n#### How to create diff\n\nIt's actually quite easy. Just follow this command:\n\n*diff -rupN \\\u003csource\\\u003e \\\u003ctarget\\\u003e \\\u003e \\\u003coutput\\\u003e*\n\nWith:\n\n\\- r to compare with subdirectories, subfolders\n\n\\- u outputs NUM (default 3) lines of unified context (yeah I don't get\nit)\n\n\\- p shows which C function each change is in\n\n\\- N treats absent files as empty\n\nOr:\n\n*git diff \\\u003csource\\\u003e \\\u003ctarget\\\u003e \\\u003e \\\u003coutput\\\u003e*\n\n#### Patch new driver into the kernel\n\nI first tried using */dev/null* as source to diff against *r8152.c* file\nfrom Realtek, and then put it in as patch. I deleted a patch related to\n*r8152.c* so it remained original to kernel source. I put the patch in\n*target/linux/generic/hack-5.15*, same as where I deleted the previous\npatch. But replacing the kernel driver wasn't easy, I tried\n\n*\\-\\-- a/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*\n\n*+++ /dev/null*\n\n*\\-\\-- /dev/null*\n\n*+++ b/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*\n\nor\n\n*\\-\\-- /dev/null*\n\n*+++ b/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*\n\nThe source didn't compile due to the file already existing in the\nkernel.\n\nSo I did the hard way. I went into *dl* folder, extract *r8152.c* from\n*linux-5.15.117.tar.xz* (at the time OpenWrt was built on kernel\n5.15.117) then diff against the same file from Realtek. It compiled\nsuccessfully. I could run it well on a virtual machine.\n\n![](/images/blog/230623/patch_2.jpg)\n\nApparently, the compiler doesn't read anything above the first change in\nthe patch. So the lines before that is considered comments to the\ncompiler. I added a note to say that this driver is not from the kernel\nsource.\n\n#### Patch new driver into ImmortalWrt\n\nI also used ImmortalWrt 21.02 for testing their software offloading\n*TurboACC*. Originally, ImmortalWrt wouldn't compile with the original\nsource because of lack of 'libcap'. I found out that the library existed\nin 22.03 of OpenWrt, not in 21.02 which was the base for ImmortalWrt. So\nI copied it from OpenWrt at *package/libs/libcap* and took it to\nImmortalWrt. It compiled.\n\n#### Test RTL8153 using OpenWrt\n\nI tested it using my device and iperf3.

Unfortunately, my [network\ndriver](https://www.realtek.com/en/component/zoo/category/network-interface-controllers-10-100-1000m-gigabit-ethernet-usb-3-0-software)\nwon't compile under Linux kernel version 6.1. I thought they were just\nkidding when they said kernel version \\\u003c= 5.17. So I held off upgrading\nmy server to Debian 12. A short while back, I read this\n[post](https://jamesachambers.com/orange-pi-i96-getting-started-guide/)\nabout getting i96 board from Orange Pi to work. That got me thinking.\n[Are kernel and OS\nseparated?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/913351/why-are-the-operating-system-and-kernel-treated-separately-in-linux)\nThe board in question could run Debian 11 Bullseye on kernel 3.10, which\nwas very old.\n\n#### Debian 10\n\nBecause I couldn't find the ISO for Debian 11 that is currently on my\nserver to replicate the server environment on a VM, I used Debian 10\nISO. Lucky enough! It came with kernel 4.19. While installing, I tried\nusing a mirror server from Vietnam to speed up downloading packages. It\nworked! So good that I changed mirrors on my server, my laptop OS to\nVietnam to. As previously, I downloaded packages from the sources, which\nare from the US so they were slow.\n\nI upgraded [Debian 10 to\n11](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/update-upgrade-debian-10-to-debian-11-bullseye/)\nby changing all instances of *buster* in */etc/apt/source.list* to\n*bullseye* and use *apt full-upgrade*. Debian 11 gave me kernel 5.10,\nsame as my server. I added the\n[*backport*](https://wiki.debian.org/Backports) repository to the apt\nsource list, because they have new softwares and kernels there:\n\n*deb http://debian.xtdv.net/debian/ bullseye-backports main*\n\nNext, I searched for a new kernel by filtering apt list:\n\n*apt list linux-image\\* \\| less*\n\nIt came up with tons of results so it could get confusing. Fortunately,\nthe kernel the OS used probably looks like *linux-image-5.10.0-23-amd64*\nso using this, I could track down the kernel I need, like\n*linux-image-6.1.0-0.deb11.7-amd64*. I did try one with *cloud* in it,\nand it shrunk the font on screen. After installing, it would generate a\nnew config file for the boot loader, GRUB. The next restart, it will\n*reboot to the new kernel*. And it did. Here was the result\nof *uname -a*:\n\n*Linux debian 6.1.0-0.deb11.7-amd64 \\#1 SMP PREEMPT\\_DYNAMIC Debian\n6.1.20-2\\~bpo11+1 (2023-04-23) x86\\_64 GNU/Linux*\n\n*¬†*\n\nI also tried upgrading to Debian 12 while *holding* the\n*linux-image-amd64* from upgrading, to see if it was possible to get to\nDebian 12 without using kernel 6.1. It also worked.\n\n#### Lubuntu 22.04\n\nI replicated the experiment on a fresh Lubuntu 22.04.2 VM. It was a bit\ndifferent. The package I was looking for was\n*linux-image-5.15.0-73-generic*. The newest kernel they got was\n*linux-image-5.19.0-43-generic* so I tried *linux-image-6.1.0-1013-oem*.\nIt booted back in after installing and restarting the VM.\n\n#### Compiling driver\n\nBack to Debian 11 with kernel 6.1, I tried compiling driver again after\ninstalling *linux-headers-6.1.0-0.deb11.7-amd64*.

I downloaded it and compiled against kernel\nversion 6.1 and installed it. It worked, without any errors from the old\nversion. There was also a driver already in the kernel so I tested both\ndrivers. The in-tree kernel module required firmwares to be installed,\nyou can find it in *firmware-realtek* package in *bullseye-backports*\nrepository. However, Debian didn\\'t recognize the network USB, so I have\nto force driver by hand using this command as root (not sudo, it didn\\'t\nwork):\n\n*echo 0bda 8156 \\\u003e /sys/bus/usb/drivers/r8152/new\\_id*\n\nThen it recognized the USB. By using **iperf3**, I measured performance\nbetween 2 drivers. While they were able to saturate the 1Gbps bandwidth,\nthe in-tree module took 10% more CPU usage compared to the Realtek\ndriver. The in-tree module also required a hacky workaround for the\nserver to recognize, so I opted for the Realtek one."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:Tb8c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After writing blogs for over a month, I checked to see if my blog showed\nup on Google Search.

I thought that was\nsome kind of April Fool joke so I ignored it. Today, I received a\ncommunity post by Youtuber [Cynical\nReviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DCPS2j-o0bvfIilkc8RSw/community?lb=UgkxRDC4JuhK_O3jyMqIIyGe8a0u850H6qTR)\nsaying the same thing yesterday. So I thought: \"We're in the endgame\nnow\".\n\n![](ic/images/blog/230511/ban_adblock.png)\n\n#### My history of the Internet\n\nI've been with the Internet since the very beginning of it. I used\ndial-up back in the 2000s and switched to DSL later on. My family used\nto chat on Yahoo Messenger, play flash games (RIP Adobe Flash, you will\nbe missed for your large catalog of content you provided for us), play\nBoom Online, and watch videos on Youtube. Those days, Internet was\nexpensive, counted by MBs you consumed, so you had to watch the amount.\nI only downloaded heavy files at night to cut cost. But it was less\nrestrictive, less corporate, curated like today. It was the \"wild west\"\nwhere anything could happen. You could find fun things while searching\nthe old web. Back at that time, it was Yahoo Search, nobody heard of\nGoogle yet. Youtube was its own company then, just launched. I started\nwatching it at a later time. I used to watch Inuyasha, the entire\ncollection on Youtube, because copyright wasn't enforced then. I started\nwatching [nigahiga](https://www.youtube.com/@ryanhiga) in 2021. If you\nfollow his channel, you can basically see the history of Youtube and the\nworld of the second decade of the 21^st^ century unfolds.\n\n#### What's wrong with today's Youtube?\n\nIt's generally what's wrong when anything becomes too big, too popular.\nIt's becoming sanitized, safe, family-friendly (whatever that means),\ncorporate. And Youtube is no exception. I see its changes from a service\ncentered around its creator to slowly moving away, instead pleasing the\nadvertizers, the investors, the big names in the MSM (mainstream media).\nSo Google created various changes to their platform, including but not\nlimited to: demonetize any video with curse words in it (even videos not\nmeant for kids); false copyright claims run rampant (even on channels\nwhose videos are owned by the creator get copyrighted); losing revenue\nby Youtube taking your copyrighted video and giving it to the \"original\"\nowner; ad runtime increase; before video then after video then middle,\nfrom 3, 5 seconds, to 15 seconds, skippable to nowadays unskippable,\nsome ads even 15 minutes, a lot of them are scam;\n[Adpocalypse](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/YouTube_Adpocalypse);\nand now, about to force me to turn off ad-blocker.\n\n#### Commentary\n\nLike hell I'm turning off ad-blocker. This has been going on at other\nsites as well. They detect that you're using ad-blocker, block the site\nand \"ask\" you to take it down. Sure, take it down so they can shove ads\ncovering your screen, loud videos in your face. While I can ignore any\nother sites doing this, I can't ignore Youtube. It has become a large\npart of everyone's lives and livelihoods. I can just buy Premium and\nforget about all this, but that's on top of more bills to pay (Netflix,\nInternet, VieOn), and you pay for something that is and will always be\nfree. Maybe you can buy it to support your creators, but that's the\ncase, why do they have to take sponsorships and Patreons, open their own\nmerchandise store then? Sponsorships are ads that are on top of\nYoutube's dumb ads, this time INSIDE the videos. As seen in adguard's\n[article](https://adguard.com/en/blog/firefox-manifestv3-chrome-adblocking.html)\nand EFF's\n[article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening),\nthis isn't the first time Google tried to shut down ad-block. And to me,\nit's kind of depressing thinking about what's to come, as the Internet\nbecomes more restrictive as time goes on. Soon due to geopolitics, there\nwill be a localNet^(tm)^ instead of Internet, where each country has\ntheir own version of the Internet. And because your typical user doesn't\ncare, they will stay on Chrome and Youtube, which Google has the power\nover and can tell us what to see and not see, not just ads, but contents\nthat fit their \"vision\". Firefox may give us some freedom from Chrome\nnow, but for how long? I saw even Mozilla has lost its\n[focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/)\n[over](https://mozilla.social/explore) the years. I thought DuckDuckGo\nfocuses on privacy, but then [they sell your data to\nMicrosoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-browser-allows-microsoft-trackers-due-to-search-agreement/).\nMy favored Linux distribution, Ubuntu, becomes more corporate, forcing\nweird decisions like [this](https://evertpot.com/firefox-ubuntu-snap/)\nand\n[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/j3ajnf/whats_wrong_with_snaps_why_so_many_people_hate_it/).\nReading\n[on](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/wxra6o/we_already_live_in_a_cyberpunk/)\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/b5srqp/do_we_live_in_cyberpunk_already/),\nand recently finished watching [Cyberpunk\nEdgerunner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtqIas3bYhg), I think we are\nalready living in a cyberpunk dystopia. Various service we use for our\nconveniences like Facebook, Google might as well came out of George\nOrwell's *1984*, or I can do one better, Aldous Huxley's [*Brave New\nWorld*](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yq7yt/so_i_read_brave_new_world_how_is_it_a_dystopia/).\nMaybe\\...

The reason\nfor the *LTS* or *Long Term Support* is because of chip shortage, they\nlacked the Realtek RTL8211 chip for the WAN port, so they substituted it\nwith Motorcomm YT8531C because it was more abundant. I plan to use this\nboard as either a DNS Server to speed up domain querying in place of my\nRaspberry Pi, or as a router. There is a similar board which this one\ntakes inspiration from (including device tree source, more on that\nlater), [NanoPi\nR2S](https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product\u0026product_id=282).\nHowever, that board was pricier and I felt a bit adventurous that day.\nSo first off, I tried out Openwrt on this board, since it was\nrecommended by the board manufacturer.\n\n![](/images/blog/230523/my_r1.jpg)\n\n#### Different flavors of OpenWrt\n\nWhen I bought this board used, they gave me a metal case, a 32GB SD card\nwith their own version of OpenWrt 21.02 installed. It was packed to the\nbrim with stuff, Docker, adblock, bandwidth monitor, wake on LAN,\ntorrent downloader, DLNA, Dynamic DNS. It wasn't for my liking since it\nslowed the OS down so I tried something else.\n\nFollowing [this\npage](https://orangepi.vn/huong-dan-tai-cac-ban-openwrt-cho-orange-pi-r1-plus-lts.html),\nI tried out the manufacturer's OpenWrt. Much like the previous one, it\nwas based on 21.02 but fairly minimal. A Youtube named Van Tech Corner\n[created his own OpenWrt\nrelease](https://github.com/vantechcorner/openwrt-orangepi) from the\n[source code provided by the\nmanufacturer](https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/openwrt). You can\ncheck out the [unboxing and\ntesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtdBMK8Cyx0\u0026pp=ygUMb3JhbmdlIHBpIHIx)\nvideo,\n[similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7dTmngyaVM\u0026pp=ygUKbmFub3BpIHIycw%3D%3D)\nvideo for NanoPi R2S. The two releases differ in the number of packages\npreinstalled. I tested the Van Tech's one. It was better because of its\nslim size. But when I tried to install any package that has a kernel\ndependency, like Wireguard, 4G USB support (RNDIS), it said *The\ninstalled version of package kernel is not compatible.* According to the\nOpenWrt [page](https://openwrt.org/faq/cannot_satisfy_dependencies),\nthese were self-compiled image, and couldn't use kernel-related packages\nfrom the official repository, but had to be either included in or built\nbeforehand and installed externally. I tried out OpenWrt official\ndownload [page](https://downloads.openwrt.org/), but no luck for this\nboard. NanoPi R2S did have an image, though. So I'm out of luck until\nofficial support from OpenWrt or Orange Pi, right?\n\n#### A daring approach: Compile from source\n\nBefore this, I compiled Asterisk for my VOIP server experiment. It was\nthe recommended way of installing it, as the one on the Ubuntu repo\n(repository) is old. I just followed the instructions and it compiled\nand installed. Another instance is driver install. Some drivers like my\nRTL8156 2.5Gbps Ethernet USB for my server had to be compiled from\nsource because again, Debian's one was too old to support it. So I\nchecked out source code from [Van\nTech](https://github.com/vantechcorner/openwrt-orangepi),\nwhich is a derivative (or fork) of the source code from Orange Pi's\nOpenWrt. At first, I just randomly followed instruction, feeds update,\nfeeds install. Inside menuconfig, Global build settings, I picked\n*Select all target specific packages by default*, *Select all kernel\nmodule packages by default*. So it took *a few hours* to either compiled\nand didn't run on the R1 Plus board, or it caught an error halfway.\nAfter a few more tries, I eventually got it compiling correctly, though\nI chose to *make -j1* because I needed to trace the error if it popped\nup.\n\n![](/images/blog/230523/menuconfig.jpg)\n\nAfter testing the compiled image on the board to verify it running\ncorrectly, I searched Google and found [this forum post from OpenWrt and\nimage and source code from\nwalmartshopper](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/orange-pi-r1-plus-support/84824/246).\nIt was newer, version 22.03, and it worked using their provided image.\n\nI got curious about the changes in the source code that Orange Pi made,\nso I used Visual Studio Code to look into the source. I searched for\nanything related to Orange Pi R1 Plus (LTS included) and came across\nmultiple results. I will tell you some notable ones:\n\n![](/images/blog/230523/kernel_patch.jpg)\n\n\\- The .patch files inside *target/linux/rockchip/patches-5.4* and\n*package/boot/uboot-rockchip/patches*. According to\n[kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/process/applying-patches.html),\nthese are kernel patches. This is how Orange Pi add support for their R1\nPlus (and LTS) board to OpenWrt, even though you can't find this board\non OpenWrt's download page. They patched dts files in the kernel, in\naddition to the YT8531C driver for the ethernet.\n\n\\- *target/linux/rockchip/image/armv8.mk* shows how OpenWrt build the\nimage for the board, as well as *package/boot/uboot-rockchip/Makefile*\nfor the bootloader.\n\nNote that this is an ARM processor, so the boot process is different\nthan your computer. It requires a dtb, or a device tree blob that is\ncompiled from dts - device tree source file, and its own bootloader.\nThey usually use U-Boot. To this day, Orange Pi R1 Plus (and LTS) dts\nfiles haven't been upstreamed, or merged back to the OpenWrt source. The\nLinux kernel source has upstreamed dts for R1 Plus on v6.3 and LTS on\nv6.4. Maybe in the future, as there has been several attempts at doing\nso at OpenWrt pull requests.\n\nLooking at other git repos like from\n[walmartshopper](https://github.com/walmartshopper/openwrt-orangepi-r1-plus/commits/openwrt-22.03?author=walmartshopper),\n[baiyut](https://github.com/baiywt/openwrt/commits/openwrt-22.03?author=baiywt)\n(who is in charge of the patches in Orange Pi OpenWrt, his own repo also\nhas OpenWrt 22.03),\n[ImmortalWrt](https://github.com/immortalwrt/immortalwrt) (which allows\nnon-upstreamable patches), they also applied this technique to support\nthe R1 Plus (and LTS). From [walmartshopper's\nrepo](https://github.com/walmartshopper/openwrt-orangepi-r1-plus/commits/openwrt-22.03?author=walmartshopper),\nI tried merging OpenWrt 22.03 current branch to his, but the number of\nconflicts is too big, I wondered if the amount of work put into keeping\nR1 Plus up-to-date with OpenWrt was this huge. It's quite amazing.\n\nIn the future, with the release of OpenWrt 23.05, if those customized\nrepos don't support the board, and OpenWrt doesn't support either, I\nwill see if it's possible to port the files for R1 Plus (and LTS) over.\n\n#### Note on using Android TV Box as router\n\nBefore all this, I tried testing a X96 Air S905X3 4GB and Mecool M8S Pro\nW S905W 2GB with this OpenWrt implementation by\n[ophub](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt). He used Armbian\nbootloader to boot to OpenWrt environment. One of the flaws I discovered\nafter testing [Coreelec](https://coreelec.org/) on the Mecool is that [I\ncan\\'t boot back to Armbian or OpenWrt\nanymore](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/18871-boot-from-usb-having-armbian-on-emmc/),\ndue to Coreelec overwriting the eMMC bootloader and I don't want to\nre-flash Android on the TV Box. In fact, this was exactly why I\npurchased this Orange Pi R1 Plus LTS board. So I don't have to go\nthrough this hassle with TV Box. And in the event of Raspberry Pi\nshortage such as right now, I want to switch to alternative single board\ncomputers such as Orange Pi from now on. While support is spotty, they\noutperform the Raspberry Pi and don't *cost an arm and a leg* to buy.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [OpenWrt source\ncode](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/source-code/start)\n\n\\- [OpenWrt Build system\nusage](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"18:Tc16,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This post is supposed to be an update on the 4G-to-Wifi series\n*Upgrading Grandparents' Wifi* I did previously. But discussing with my\nfamily has led me to contemplate that saying. My country has a similar\none: *cure a healthy pig and make it lame as a result* or *ch·ªØa l·ª£n l√†nh\nth√†nh l·ª£n qu√®*.\n\n#### The update\n\nAfter a month of running my grandparents' network on 4G, on April 23\n2023, the project was effectively shut down. The Mi Wifi R3G router was\ninstead connected to SCTV cable Internet, which is rated at 50 Mbps. A\nfew problems rose from the project:\n\n\\- 4G network was unstable. Sure, it worked. But it disconnected every\nfew days, forcing me to reconnect it.\n\n\\- It wasn't as fast as I hoped. When the towel wasn't congested, it\ncould reach 80 Mbps. But most of the time, inconsistent from 15 to 50\nMbps. That wasn't any better than our cable Internet. It could be\nbecause the 4G USB modem is cheap, so the antenna quality wasn't good,\nor it couldn't utilize Carrier Aggregation, which is something you'd\nfind on modern smartphones. My phone can easily reach 190 Mbps download\nout of our nearest towel alone.\n\n\\- Double pay. We already paid for our cable Internet, now I had to pay\nmy own to do this experiment. So it wasn't meant to last.\n\nSo now the 4G modem sits in my inventory, occasionally being pulled out\nof its slumber so I can test it on my laptop for fun. Guess it can only\nbe used as backup.\n\n#### The proverb\n\n![](/images/blog/230506/Picture1.png)\n\nMy hobby is interesting. I regularly install, uninstall, dismantle,\nreassemble things more times than I could count. But it comes with\nkarma. I can't stop. Like if there was something to improve\ntechnologically in my house, or there were techs that intrigued me, I\nwould try it out, which usually ends up breaking everything else. Can't\ncount the number of close-calls I had with my devices breaking because\nof the new things I put in, lack of precaution, no backup plan\\... I am\nconstantly reminded by my family \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\". It's\na similar thing I learned when I was still working as a software\ndeveloper. Because a lot of functions in a software are built on top of\neach other, they act like a domino chain. If one falls, every one will\nfall, too. Heck, my 4G-to-wifi project had to be pulled partly because\nof my endless experiments on the Pi router end up breaking the network\nfrom time to time. My family said: \"Enough with this. Return everything\nback to **normal**. You had your fun. If it ain't broke, don't fix it\".\nMaybe they're right. After all, this is just to satisfy my boundless\ncuriosity. Nobody is going to care where they got their Internet from,\nor how fast. They only concern whether it will get them to Facebook. To\nthem, a DNS Server to speed up 1 second of scrolling through posts does\nnothing. It does to me. It makes a 50 Mbps cable Internet feel like it\ncan match the snappiness of a 150 Mbps fiber connection.\n\nI feel like anyone who is an artisan, an engineer, a mechanic, or works\nin the technology sector, may run into something similar to the problem\nI have."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:T19b2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I am a media consumption enthusiast. Let's just say I watch movies a\nlot. Usually, people like me will have a big home theater setup with a\nlarge TV, a large speaker set, a media player with huge HDD storage. But\nthat sounds like too much work, since you have to update the hard drive\nconstantly with new catalogues. So I built my server out of an old i3\nlaptop, a SSD, 2 HDD lying around with a dock and an Ethernet USB\ndongle. I chose 2.5 Gbps dongle version because I wanted to future-proof\nmy server. But that proved to be my undoing, because the OS I chose for\nmy server, Debian, had an older version of the driver that didn't\nsupport the RTL8156 chipset. It might support an older one, the RTL8153,\nwhich is the 1 Gbps variant. So I searched for its driver. It's quite a\nlittle adventure.\n\n![](/images/blog/230504/DKMS_flow.webp)\n\n#### First time compiling from source\n\nA Google search for RTL8156 driver for linux led me to the\nmanufacturer's driver page to download the driver. However, the\ncompressed file I downloaded (in this instance .tar.bz2) didn't have any\n.deb file to install. Instead I was left with a bunch of .h, .c files\nwith a Makefile. I thought: \"Wait. This is a source code!\".\n\nSo far, I have mostly installed apps and drivers through apt so this was\na new territory. I did some researches and tried compiling the driver.\nIn the source code folder, I typed:\n\n*make -j4*\n\nWith -j4 being number of jobs to run simultaneously, 4 is the number of\nthreads of my CPU. After it finished, the result was r8152.ko file, a\nkernel module. I plugged in the Ethernet USB. It didn't work. Then I\ntried loading the module into the kernel like [this\narticle](https://www.tecmint.com/load-and-unload-kernel-modules-in-linux/)\nsuggested:\n\n*insmod r8152.ko*\n\nThen it worked. My server recognized it.\n\n*ip a*\n\n*3: enx00e04e3b0ac0: \\\u003cBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER\\_UP\\\u003e mtu 1500 qdisc\npfifo\\_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000*\n\nI edited the *interface*s file in */etc/network* to assign it a static\naddress by adding:\n\n*allow-hotplug enx00e04e3b0ac0*\n\n*iface enx00e04e3b0ac0 inet static*\n\n*address 192.168.4.3/24*\n\n*gateway 192.168.4.1*\n\nFor then on, I could access my server in my house through that IP,\n*192.168.4.3.*\n\nBut I discovered that:\n\n\\- At start-up, I have to *insmod* like that to load the module. This\nwas solved by simply copying that module to /lib/modules/\\$(uname\n-r)/kernel/drivers/net/usb. Didn't have to *insmod* anymore. But that\nwasn't all.\n\n\\- Every time I update the server with apt update, apt upgrade, and\nthere is a kernel update, I have to compile module from source, copy it\nover again or else I lose the driver. So I often delay updating my\nserver, which is bad because you want to keep your kernel up-to-date on\nbugfix, vulnerabilities.\n\nI needed a way to make it compile every time there is a kernel update.\nSo is there a way?\n\n#### dkms - Dynamic Kernel Module Support\n\nNowadays, I use an Ubuntu desktop as my main driver. I often see\nsomething along the line of dkms for my Nvidia card anytime there is a\nkernel update. After rebooting, the video card still works with the new\nkernel. Naturally, I started looking into this \"dkms\".\n\nAccording to this [article](https://linuxhint.com/dkms-linux/), dkms\n*\"is a framework where device driver source can reside outside the\nkernel source tree so that it is very easy to rebuild modules as you\nupgrade kernels\"*. So this is the stuff I was looking for. The author\nalso encountered dkms similarly to me, but by following guides to\ninstall his Wifi driver.\n\nSo with the source code of my Ethernet USB, I copied it to */usr/src*. I\nalso created a file inside the source code's folder, *dkms.conf* with\nthe following content:\n\n*PACKAGE\\_NAME=\\\"r8152\\\"*\n\n*PACKAGE\\_VERSION=\\\"2.15.0\\\"*\n\n*BUILT\\_MODULE\\_NAME\\[0\\]=\\\"r8152\\\"*\n\n*MAKE=\\\"\\'make\\' -j\\$(nproc) KVER=\\$\\{kernelver\\}\\\"*\n\n*CLEAN=\\\"\\'make\\' clean\\\"*\n\n*DEST\\_MODULE\\_LOCATION\\[0\\]=\\\"/kernel/drivers/net/usb/\\\"*\n\n*AUTOINSTALL=\\\"YES\\\"*\n\nPACKAGE\\_NAME gives the name to the entire package of modules.\n\nPACKAGE\\_VERSION give the version of the entire package of modules being\ninstalled with dkms. These two form the name of the folder that contains\nthe source code, *r8152-2.15.0.\n\nBUILT\\_MODULE\\_NAME gives the name of the module just after it is built.\n\nDEST\\_MODULE\\_LOCATION specifies the destination where a module should\nbe installed to, once compiled. From the example: /lib/modules/\\$(uname\n-r)*/kernel/drivers/net/usb*.\n\nNote that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of \\#\nmust be the same for each of BUILT\\_MODULE\\_NAME and\nDEST\\_MODULE\\_LOCATION and that the numbering should start at 0. So each\nmodule goes with its own destination\n\nMAKE and CLEAN correspond to commands used to run when dkms builds\n(make) the module and cleans up after.\n\nAUTOINSTALL is set to yes so that the service\n/etc/rc.d/init.d/dkms\\_autoinstaller will automatically try to install\nthis module when upgrading kernel.\n\nAfter that, I ran three commands:\n\n\\- *sudo dkms add r8152/2.15.0*\n\n\\- *sudo dkms build r8152/2.15.0*\n\n\\- *sudo dkms install r8152/2.15.0*\n\nAnd it installed the driver to the kernel. From then on, it will build\nand reinstall anytime I upgrade the kernel.\n\nResult:\n\n*sudo dkms add r8152/2.15.0*\n\n*Creating symlink /var/lib/dkms/r8152/2.15.0/source -\\\u003e*\n\n*/usr/src/r8152-2.15.0*\n\n*DKMS: add completed.*\n\n*sudo dkms build r8152/2.15.0*\n\n*Kernel preparation unnecessary for this kernel.

When checking out the best deals from my\ncountry's cell companies, I searched Google for illegitimate websites\ninstead of going straight to the sources. They have a tendency to hide\ntheir promotional data plans deep within the Internet, and only show\nstandard data plans on their websites. I came across a few ones that\ncaught my attention. They all had something to do with free data under\nselected services:\n\n\\- YT30 from Viettel allowed you to watch Youtube videos and didn't\ncount towards your data caps\n\n\\- Big50Y from Vinaphone allowed watching Youtube, Tiktok, using Zalo\napps not counting towards caps and gave you 5 GB per day\n\n\\- Y60, our subject of investigation today, allowed the same things and\ngave you 2GB per day.They came with a requirement of the promotion only\napplies to the Youtube, Tiktok apps.\n\nSo I plan to investigate whether it could be applied to the website, and\ncould it be used on a laptop when tethered to.\n\n#### Preparation\n\nWhen I tried to register Y60 data plan on my Mobifone, I did not qualify\nfor it because it required that I was born before 1995. But I was able\nto register for **G1** data plan, which included free data for the\nfollowing apps: Instagram, ZingTv, Zing MP3, Gmail, Google Drive, Zalo,\nViber, Tiktok, FPT Play. I also found another SIM on Vinaphone to\nregister **GT1** data plan, which included free data for Youtube, VieOn,\nNhaccuatui, Tiktok.\n\nFor Mobifone, they required you to install an app called mobifoneGo.\nThis app would tell you when an app launched is permitted for free data.\nIn addition, it also allows you to buy extra data plans for specific\napps you want free.\n\n![](/images/blog/230427/mobifonego.jpg)\n\n#### Result\n\nAccording to my findings, mobifoneGo created a VPN that only tunneled\ntraffic through if it was coming from the selected apps. For example, I\nused FPT Play to watch some TV using 4G. When I activated 4G, a VPN\ntunnel was opened and when FPT Play was opened, the program showed a\nnotification stating that I had obtained unlimited data and using FPT\nPlay didn't reduce my data cap. If it had been any other apps, it\nwouldn't have worked and my data cap would be decreased. I tried\nbroadcasting Wifi to my laptop to see if [https://fptplay.vn/](https://fptplay.vn/) counted\nas free data but it didn't work, not even creating a proxy using Every\nProxy to go through the VPN tunnel on the phone solved it. It reduced my\ndata cap.

They have a IP whitelist for the free-data plan. For\nexample, Youtube had the following IP list when I queried it using my\nDNS Server:\n\n*;; ANSWER SECTION:*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.136*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.93*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.91*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.190*\n\nSo it's likely Vinaphone allowed these IPs to not reduce my data cap\nwhen I watched videos on them. It worked even when I tethered the phone\nto my laptop to access Youtube on the web browser.\n\n#### Zero-rating and net neutrality\n\nBasically, when you use Internet on your phone through technologies like\n3G, 4G, LTE, you have a data plan ahead with some limit on how much you\ncan consume. And some carriers sell special plans that allow you to\naccess some online services without reducing your data caps, usually\nrelated to video streaming, communication\\... That practice is known as\n**zero-rating**. I got introduced to this concept by chance. First by\ncoming across BIG50Y data plan from Vinaphone, and the word came about\nlater when I was researching on this topic. This practice just showed up\nin Vietnam recently, while had shown up in the US before. Like **Binge\nOn** from T-Mobile that doesn't reduce data cap when you watch videos on\nYoutube, Netflix, HBO\\... but how they go about doing it is [throttling\nbandwidth of **any** videos regardless of\nservices](EFF Confirms: T-Mobile‚Äôs Binge On Optimization is Just Throttling, Applies Indiscriminately to All Video).\n\nFacebook also jumped on the zero-rating bandwagon with their own [Free\nBasics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet.org) (internet.org)\nprogram, which granted you free access to Facebook (duh!) and other\nservices that had made deal with Facebook. It used to be deployed in\nthird world nations like India, Myanmar, but has since been removed.\nBecause it's a double-edged sword.\n\nOn the one hand, this exercise goes against net neutrality.\n\n![](/images/blog/230427/facebook-freebasics-india-1100px.webp)\n\nWhat is net neutrality you may ask? **Net neutrality** is the principle\nthat an ISP has to provide access to all sites, online services with the\nsame speed, same treatments without blocking, slowing down or give\n\"special treatment\" to any others. It's the idea that governs free\nInternet as we now know today. So **zero-rating** is essentially ISP\nplaying favorites to those paying to sponsor your data, whether is\ncontent provider like Youtube, social media like Facebook, or both like\nTiktok. ISP can also play favorites to their own services. Why would you\nwant to watch live streaming on website A when service B, offered by the\nISP, charged nothing and reduced no data cap. Thus creating an unfair\nadvantage to anyone not willing to \"pay-to-win\", as the term from online\ngames goes. The consumers are disincentivized to explore alternative\nsites, leaving \"sponsored\" sites the only choices they have, closing of\nthe Internet to a few sites. [There were surveys conducted in various\ncountries showed that people thought Facebook is the\nInternet](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet).\n\nAnother problem arises is privacy and security concern over the practice\nof checking packet (or packet inspection) to see whether it goes to the\nzero-rated destination, or man-in-the-middle proxy to check its content\nlike Free Basics.\n\n![](/images/blog/230427/free_basics_proxy.png)\n\nThe practice gives too much power to the ISP, who can now decide which\nservice providers it likes, which it doesn't and limit them.\n\nAn article on\n[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/wtf-is-zero-rating/)\npointed out the logical fallacy I liked about zero-rating. Basically, if\nyou can infinitely watch video on their chosen platform, then there must\nbe enough bandwidth to handle it. If that were true, data caps wouldn't\nbe necessary at all. Which brings the whole zero-rating practice to\nquestion.\n\nThere are, however, arguments to be made about the necessity of\nzero-rating in very poor countries like\n[Laos](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31463249), or continents [in\nAfrica](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/facebook-second-life-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-tech-company-in-africa).\nWhere there isn't enough money to eat, let alone spending it on data and\nInternet, zero-rating at least gives people a chance to learn, a\nplatform for commerce, a tool for cheaper communication, however\nlimited. According to a Reddit comment about Free Basics, [\"it does\ninclude free access to Wikipedia as well as other sites like\nDictionary.com, a translator, BBC News, lots of Indian news sites,\nWikiHow, Unicef and various other sources of health\ninformation.\\\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3z94u3/a_week_after_india_banned_it_facebooks_free/)\nDepriving people of the Internet altogether means losing out on an\nutility we all take for granted today. As a short term solution, it\\'s\nan unequivocal yes. There are an unbelievable number of African\nbusinesses that exist only because of the [Facebook's Free\nBasics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/facebook-second-life-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-tech-company-in-africa)\nprogram. But calling it \"Digital colonialism\" is not fall from the\ntruth, as [Facebook became the Internet itself in the eyes of a majority\nof\nAfricans](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/facebook-free-basics-internet-africa-mark-zuckerberg).\nHence why it was banned in India.\n\nAnother use case for the practice is free access to public service, such\nas in medical, education, as pointed out by this [blog\npost](https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/is-zero-rating-a-threat-to-human-rights).\nThe Colombian Government sanctioned zero-rated educational services so\nthat students wouldn't miss school during COVID pandemic. The Australian\nand the UK partnered up with mobile carriers to curb misinformation\nabout public health, reduce cost barrier, achieve health equality. \"Not\nonly did the service allow people to use online services to access\nmedical records, book appointments, and other services, but it also\nenabled them to obtain information on several health topics\".\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\"\u003e\n    \u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfY1NKrzqi0?si=UCtLbr28hEZT_oJY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAfter a lot of articles, researches on these topics, it's hard for me to\ndecide whether this should be acceptable. I'm pro net-neutrality. I'm\nagainst the idea of a walled-garden for the Internet. But zero-rating\nhas its use, IMHO only for public services or disaster situation. It\nshouldn't be used as a way to stifle competition.\n\n#### Note: Fun fact about T-Mobile's Binge On\n\nIf you check out this\n[article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies),\nElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) did an experiment to check if\nT-Mobile throttled their downloads based on their contents and\nprotocols. From the result, it could be seen that they throttled\nbandwidth **only** when they could **detect** the content type or file\ntype, which was only possible on HTTP because HTTPS encrypted data.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality)\n\n\\- [Zero-rating and what\\'s wrong with\nit?](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/wtf-is-zero-rating/)\n\n\\- [How does an unlimited YouTube data plan work (StreamOn, T-mobile,\nDe)?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-an-unlimited-YouTube-data-plan-work-StreamOn-T-mobile-De-How-does-it-know-if-I-am-streaming-from-a-laptop-connected-at-a-mobile-hotspot-or-if-I-am-watching-from-my-phone-through-the-YouTube-app)\n\n\\- [G1 MobiFone](https://mobifonego.vn/goi-g1-mobifone/)\n\n\\- [GT1 Vinaphone](https://vinaphone.com.vn/di-dong/GT1/)\n\n\\- [Can I get the routing table entry in\nAndroid?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6940973/can-i-get-the-routing-table-entry-in-android)\n\n\\- [Free Basics vs. Free Internet: Your Guide to the Raging Net\nNeutrality\nDebate](https://www.gadgets360.com/internet/features/free-basics-vs-free-internet-your-guide-to-the-raging-net-neutrality-debate-782554)\n\n\\- [Free Basics Technical\nGuidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/platform-technical-guidelines)\n\n\\- [The Rise and Fall... and Rise Again of Facebook's Free Basics: Civil\nSociety and the Challenge of Resistance to Corporate Connectivity\nProjects](https://globalmedia.mit.edu/2020/04/21/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-facebooks-free-basics-civil-and-the-challenge-of-resistance-to-corporate-connectivity-projects/)\n\n\\- [Is Unlimited Data Really\nUnlimited?](https://unlimitedlteadvanced.com/4g-lte/is-unlimited-data-really-unlimited/)\n\n\\- [It's a battle for internet\nfreedom](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/its-a-battle-for-internet-freedom/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1b:T1dbc,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After a blog series about using 4G as house Wifi, I need an short\narticle to breathe a bit. So this is gonna be a short one.\n\n#### Background\n\nLast year, I decided to upgrade the network in my house. My home network\nwas not much to speak of, just a Viettel modem (H646EW) connected to the\npreviously mentioned TP-Link Archer C50. My home server was connected to\nthe network through Wifi, because the router is in the kitchen while the\nserver was in my room adjacent to it, and wiring is out of the question.\nThe router slowly became a bottleneck, as the number of devices\nconnected to it increased and my server had to serve media contents\naround the house as well as download contents from the Internet.\nInternet bandwidth was also increased by the ISP to 150 Mbps and my old\nrouter could not utilized it fully, only averaging 65 Mbps. So I\nreplaced the main router with an Asus RT-AC1300UHP. It's a 2.4/5 GHz\nWifi Router with Gigabit LAN. Its specs include a quad-core Qualcomm\nIPQ4018 ARM processor at 700 MHz, 256 MB RAM, much more powerful than\nthe Archer with single-core Mediatek MT7628A MIPS running at 580 MHz\nwith only 64 MB RAM.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/router-wifi-bang-tan-kep-cong-suat-cao-asus-rt-ac1300uhp-mu-mimo.webp)\n\nI replaced the router by connecting LAN1 from H646EW to WAN of the Asus\nrouter, went in the configuration page of Asus router, changed WAN type\nto DHCP (or in this case Automatic IP). And that was it. Speed test\nusing either speedtest.net or fast.com gave me full 150 Mbps\nsymmetrical.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/asus_wan_dhcp.jpg)\n\nOne day, as I was browsing through Facebook, I came across this group\ntalking about PPPoE and using another router to \"dial\" it instead of the\none provided by the ISP. So it got me thinking: \"What if I can apply it\nto my network then?\"\n\n#### Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) and bridge mode\n\nPPPoE is a network protocol for using PPP on Ethernet. Back in the old\ndays, PPP is used for dial-up Internet access. Nowadays, PPPoE is used\nfor customer authentication, record on DSL network, fiber network. When\nyou register for Internet service, your provider will give you a\nusername for the PPPoE account, and they pre-configured the account in\ntheir modem with the password. Then from the modem, you would connect\nanother, better router to it, use it as the main point to connect to the\nInternet for all devices in your house. The reason is that ISP modems\nare usually weak, unreliable if left to handle anything to heavy. But by\nusing 2 routers, this leads to a situation called \"double NAT\", where\ntraffic coming to and from a client has to route twice before hitting\nthe Internet, increasing latency and causing problems to programs that\nneed to open port. The first drawback is why you would want to turn your\nmodem to bridge mode, so the router has to do most of the heavy lifting,\nthe modem's only job is conversion from fiber to Ethernet. The second\ndownside is kind of meaningless, as in IPv4, you most likely have an IP\naddress given by the ISP, which allows Internet access but the outside\nworld can't connect to you because a lot of users around your house also\nhave that same address (which is a large problem if you want to do\nanything involving P2P like torrenting, VOIP, online gaming. Fixing this\nis a story for another time).\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/asus_wan_dhcp.jpg)\n\nBridge mode essentially turns your modem into a bridge, \"bridge\" the ISP\nend to your router on the other end. It bypasses routing, DHCP of the\nmodem, sends traffic directly to the router.\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\nBefore performing this, I should warn you. When I performed this, I\nlocked myself out of the modem multiple times, lost access to the\nInternet, had to call their technician before resetting the modem fixed\nthe issue so that I could try again. So if your Internet is running\nfine, you shouldn't bother doing this. Maybe you can look into DMZ\nsetting if available.\n\nAnother point is that each modem is different and each ISP is different.\nSome modems may not have bridge mode available. Go through your modem's\nsettings first, talk to the ISP technician if needed before trying this.\n\nAdditionally, your router must be more powerful than your modem to go\nthrough this procedure. Because dialing PPPoE is a single-threaded task\n\\[1\\].\n\n#### How to do it?\n\nFirst, we need to change the modem to bridge mode. This depends on\nmodel, so these steps is for my Viettel GPON modem H646EW.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"flex justify-center\"\u003e\n    \u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CexU8EHlQ-0?si=KBSVzC9e2At7m7se\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nLogin to the configuration page using [https://192.168.1.1/](https://192.168.1.1/). Turn it\ninto Advanced Mode. First go to Advanced Setup on the left panel -\\\u003e LAN\nsettings to disable DHCP and Wifi Setup to disable Wifi on the modem.\n\nThen go to Advanced Setup -\\\u003e WAN Connections.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h39m19s620.png)\n\nClick Edit on any profile that is PPPoE mode if your ISP doesn't give\nyou your credential when registering for Internet service. It contains\nyour credential.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h39m37s389.png)\n\nRight click on the Password text box and click Inspect Element. Find the\n\\\u003cinput\\\u003e tag that points to the Password box, change type from\n\"PASSWORD\" to \"text\". It shall reveal your PPPoE password. Copy PPPoE\nusername and password, set status to Deactivated and click Apply.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h40m15s589.png)\n\nBack at WAN Connections, we add a new entry, Bridge Mode, then click\nAdd.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h41m38s057.png)\n\nSet status to Activated. IP choose IPv4/IPv6. At 802.1q, you have 2\noptions:\n\n\\- Tag VLAN at the modem: VLAN 35 for Viettel\n\n\\- Passthrough: pass VLAN Tagging to the router. You can usually find\nthis option under IPTV\n\nFor demonstration, I chose tagging VLAN at the modem.\n\n![](/images/blog/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h41m38s057.png)\n\nAfter that, look under the modem for its MAC address. Then connect the\nmodem LAN1 to WAN of the router. For this instance, it's an Asus\nRT-AC1300UHP. Login to Asus configuration page at [http://192.168.0.1/](http://192.168.0.1/).\nGo to Advanced Settings -\\\u003e WAN. Change WAN Connection Type to PPPoE.\nFill in your PPPoE username and password. At Special Requirement from\nISP, set No to all and put MAC address the address you found under the\nmodem. Then click Apply.

So no point beating around the bushes.\nI plan to transform my 4G connection into Wifi using whatever was\navailable to me, because I'm a cheapskate that refuse to spend money,\nbut had no problem spending it on a thermometer, then broke it by\nputting it in a freezer. I also enjoy learning how networking works, as\nI always thought that a router is like a magic box. It was when I got an\nAsus router, turned on ssh that I discovered routers are all Linux\nboxes.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\nTo prepare for this job, I dug up my old Raspberry Pi 3. I haven't had\nmuch use for it since my HP laptop took over the server work from the\nboard. It has 4 USB port and a LAN port. My plan was to turn this board\ninto a router. Just a router, not one of those combo things that you\ncommonly find. The LAN port would be connected to a Wifi access point\n(AP). For the USB port, I plugged a 4G USB Modem with a SIM card placed\nin.\n\nThe TP-Link Archer C50 router currrently in use would be turned into AP\nin place of a router. The reason was that the Raspberry Pi has a weak\nWifi chip, it couldn't transmit very far, not like a dedicated device\nwould. Moreover, I didn't need its routing function.\n\nThe 4G USB Modem would be a Sony Xperia Z. I borrowed it for this job\nbecause it wasn't in use and it could install a custom ROM or OS, free\nfrom restrictions of the original ROM. I used Lineage OS 16, which was\nAndroid 9 for the phone. Android 9 and later allows you to set your\nphone to USB tethering mode as default anytime it is connected via USB.\n\nA 4GB or higher micro SD card was needed to install a router OS of your\nchoice. In this case, OpenWrt.\n\nLocation. You need to get as close as possible to a cell tower from your\nhouse. This would require you to use a phone with the SIM card you want\nto use as the source to find a cell tower that belongs to the SIM\nnetwork. You can check signal strength by going to Settings -\\\u003e About\nphone -\\\u003e SIM Status or something similar. Keep an eye on the negative\nnumber and dBm. The higher the number (lower number in negative) the\nbetter the signal. You can also use speedtest.net or fast.com to make a\nquick speed test.\n\n#### Preparing the router\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/OpenWrt_Logo.svg)\n\nThe reason I chose OpenWrt for my router OS is that, while it's\nintriguing to DIY by using Raspbian and set everything up using iptables\nfor NAT, ufw for firewall, dnsmasq for DNS, DHCP, it's a lot of work to\nset it up separately. Instead, OpenWrt offers a web UI (luci) to help\nyou set everything up quickly. I also wanted to try it out on a real\nscenario, as before this I ran it on my virtual machine to get a feel of\nthe OS.\n\nGo to the download page of OpenWrt, get the latest version, with target\nas bcm27xx -\\\u003e bcm2710 (Raspberry Pi 3 SoC). They offer 2 choice,\next4-factory or squashfs-factory. I chose ext4 due to ease of use, as I\ncan use GParted to expand the data partition to full. squashfs takes\nmore steps, and has to be done in terminal. I might try out squashfs\nversion later, because that's the version normally used in modified\nrouters. After downloading the gzip file, extract it to get the image\n(img) file. Use either balenaEtcher or dd command to flash it to the SD\ncard (sda in this example):\n\n*dd if=openwrt.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M*\n\nAfter that, put the card in the Pi, plug in the power and boot it\nup.Connect to your Pi using LAN and open the browser, type in\n[http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/) (default IP of the LAN interface) with username\nroot, no password to enter OpenWrt management.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/1.jpg)\n\nFirst, we need to install some additional packages. Go to Network -\\\u003e\nWireless. Press Scan on a wireless interface to connect to an access\npoint.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/8.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/9.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/10.jpg)\n\nType in password of that Wifi AP and submit. On the next page, you can\njust press Save, as that page only matters when you create an AP from\nthis board. Press Save \u0026 Apply. Now go to Network -\\\u003e Interfaces. You\nshould see another interface added in.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/11.jpg)\n\nNow go to System -\\\u003e Software and update lists. You have to do this at\nevery restart when you want to install new packages.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/7.jpg)\n\nYou need to install these packages to use the 4G USB Modem, in this case\nan Android phone.\n\n#### Preparing the access point\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/config_ac50_dhcp.jpg)\n\nThere are 2 ways around this. Either set this router into Access Point\nmode, or you can turn off DHCP Server, which is a function that hands\nout IP address to devices connecting to it. I chose the latter, because\nI never had much luck with the former. Every time I try putting a router\ninto AP mode, I end up resetting it at the end due to not being able to\naccess its configuration page. But you do you.\n\nAfter that, use an Ethernet cable, connect Raspberry Pi to any LAN port\non the TP-Link router, or either LAN / WAN if you choose AP mode.\n\n#### Finding place to put the \"combo\" device\n\nAs I previously mentioned, location is important when it comes to 4G\nconnection. In my case, the house is situated near a cell tower, right\noutside the kitchen's window.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/anten.jpg)\n\nSo the obvious answer is to place the router, the access point, the\nmodem in the kitchen, right? Well, yeah. I put the combo in a chair at\nfirst, and also tried to elevate the phone using the Pi as leverage.\nThat way the phone could get the best signal. It was a sight to behold.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/combo.jpg)\n\n2 weeks after that, I got a dock to prop the phone up properly so it\nlooked more professional and moved the combo to the top of the fridge,\ncloser to the cell tower. By placing it there, I got -89 dBm, as opposed\nto -95 dBm on the chair. It was not much, because this was an old phone,\nbut good enough to work.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/phone_fridge.jpg)\n\n#### Getting the router to connect to the Internet\n\nPlugging the phone to the Raspberry Pi, I had to register the phone as a\nnetwork interface on OpenWrt. Go to Network -\\\u003e Interfaces. Click Add\nNew Interface. Name the interface. Choose DHCP client as protocol,\nbecause you will get IP address from the USB-tethered phone. In device,\nchoose usb0 and click Create Interface. On the next screen, pick\nFirewall Settings, assign the interface to wan zone then Save. After\nthat, click Save \u0026 Apply. So instead of cable Internet, I connected to\nthe Internet via 4G network.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/3.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/5.jpg)\n\nIf you prefer to use your custom DNS, go to 4G interface, Advanced\nSettings, uncheck Use DNS servers advertised by peer. Then go to Network\n-\\\u003e DHCP and DNS. Fill in your desired DNS in DNS forwardings (remember\nto press plus) then Save \u0026 Apply.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/pi_router/12.jpg)\n\n#### Result\n\nSo far so good. It worked like a dream. The Internet was a lot better.\nAnd thanks to the Raspberry Pi having a better CPU than most routers, it\ncould withstand more clients connecting to the network and route better.\nOn early morning or late night, I could get up to 80 Mbps download.\nSpeed is inconsistent throughout the day, ranging from 15 to 50 Mbps.\nBut overall, it's more stable than the cable Internet.\n\n#### Improvements\n\nAbout 3 weeks into the project, I swapped the phone for a 4G USB Modem,\nbecause doing this heated up the phone considerably and had a negative\nimpact to its battery. It's a cheap no-name one because I wasn't gonna\nfully commit to this project. It also improved signal strength, getting\nit up to -76 dBm.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/IMG_20230410_103017_860.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/4g_router/4g_1.2.jpg)\n\nI also slowly phased out the TP-Link + Pi combo in favor of a Xiaomi Mi\nWiFi R3G v1. It's a router with MT7621 SoC with dual-core 880 MHz MIPS\nprocessor, 256 MB RAM, 128MB ROM. Compared to Raspberry Pi, it's like\nDavid vs Goliath. But it does feature hardware routing capability, so\nthat's neat. It runs OpenWrt with 4G USB Modem support, so I could plug\nthe USB Modem in and be done with it. Same performance with 1 less\ndevice to worry about.\n\n![](/images/blog/230413/IMG_20230411_083037_638.jpg)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [OpenWrt Downloads](https://downloads.openwrt.org/)\n\n\\- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)\n\n\\- [LineageOS 16.0 for Xperia\nZ](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-final-9-0-lineageos-16-0-for-xperia-z.3924175/)\n\n\\- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model\nB+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)\n\n\\- [Xiaomi Mi WiFi R3G](https://openwrt.org/toh/xiaomi/mir3g)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"22:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"aNhpefP0v_OQgBffyGflX\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"mb-8 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tighter\",\"children\":\"Brian Phan\"}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"flex flex-col md:flex-row mb-12\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"mr-4 mb-4\",\"style\":{\"flex\":1},\"children\":[\"$\",\"img\",null,{\"src\":\"/images/about/portrait.jpg\"}]}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"style\":{\"flex\":2},\"children\":[[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"mb-4\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"className\":\"italic\",\"children\":\"‚ÄùIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.
