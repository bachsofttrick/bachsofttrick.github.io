LLM might not be the best tool for doing OCR, but it gave me a chance to learn about\nhow OpenAI, llama.cpp and various other LLMs communicate with their frontends and tools.\n\nTo install and use Claude Code, follow this [guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview). Very quick\nand easy. You need Claude Pro, though. With any Claude subscription, you [get](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11647753-understanding-usage-and-length-limits) 200K tokens per context window. There is also\n[usage limit](https://claude.ai/settings/usage) you have to watch out when using Claude. But I got \nClaude Code to make the frontend and burned through 80K tokens, which was around 35% limit. There is\nplenty if your project is simple. \n\nI gotta admit. This thing did my frontend in 10 minutes what I would need a few days to do. I looked\nthrough the code. It was good code, but I'm not the best developer to judge it. It just worked. \nIt even wrote the README.md, the bash script for getting the OCR model and running llama.cpp, for goodness \nsake. I guess that's what everyone is up in arms about. The machine that do the work of many days to one\n(with low price of $20/month).\n\nEssentially, Claude Code is a LLM command line program that works like how llama-cli works, with additional \nfunction calling and ability to compress a conversation in the event of low context window. \nI asked what Claude Code is and how it [compresses](https://github.com/bachsofttrick/ocr-web/blob/main/compact.md) a conversation, it even came up with an [implementation](https://github.com/bachsofttrick/ocr-web/blob/main/claude-code-impl.md) using local LLM and function calling. I'm not sure if that is how \nClaude Code is made. But it was impressive it even gave me instructions to build something similar in \nabilities.\n\nNote that Claude *only* did the frontend portion. The rest was written by me. That part doesn't work, \nthough, because llama-cpp-python was kinda useless in models outside of its [recommendations](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#multi-modal-models). I'm thinking of putting the part I did as \n\"legacy\", but who knows? I might come up with something else in mind.\n\nBut looking at it making my program, it made me sad. While it's impressive how far we've come in terms\nof AI doing our works, I missed the ability to just do it myself. Sure, it takes longer. But using\nLLM as a souped-up Google/StackOverflow to help me code is much better for me to learn the code. It makes me feel like I accomplish something, instead of directing someone to do it.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cQuote \n\tquote={\"The joy is in the journey, not the destination.\"}\n/\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8:Tc93,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"For two weeks, I have been hard at work learning FastAPI and GraphQL. And I have some opinions\non them.\n\nFirstly, I like FastAPI. It seems like Python is finally catching up to NodeJS a bit with\nimplementing async operations in this library. I think I have a soft spot for these lightweight\nlibraries: FastAPI, Flask, ExpressJS. They aren't used in large sites. Corporations prefer\nbig battle-tested frameworks more. But if I want to spin up a quick web server, these frameworks\nare my jam. I wrote my home server hub page using ExpressJS with a custom web templating engine\n(I didn't know that practice until later, go figure).\n\nHowever, I don't like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/learn/)'s documentation. They focus too much on OpenAPI/Swagger and go in-depth on what each component does. I think that would be more helpful for newcomers to the web scene. But I've been for years, and I think OpenAPI should be the focus far\nlater in the documentation. I rather just make something by using my previous knowledge\nabout web development and applying them to FastAPI, resulting in this [project](https://github.com/bachsofttrick/fast-team-task/). For this, I held [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) documentation in higher regard. Maybe because it's quicker to get into it without OpenAPI part. But automatic doc\nis nice, don't get me wrong.\n\nAnother thing I picked up while learning [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/classes-as-dependencies/) is that it's much easier understanding [Dependency Injection](/blog/Tech/250707).\nMuch like [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers) except less verbose, they have\na way to make DI enjoyable. Of course, I have to implement my own IoC container, unlike NestJS. So\nI recommend anyone wanting to learn DI, to start from FastAPI or NestJS. Starting from *.NET/C#* and\nyou see your blood on a wall from banging your head against it a lot.\n\nWhile learning FastAPI, I picked up GraphQL as well. At first, I didn't quite understand the reason for its existence. By learning about Facebook being the creator of GraphQL, and many videos later, I can see their POV. Nowadays, for one page, we need to fetch a lot of data, so a lot of API calls, which increase latency\nand loads on the backend server. Of all that APIs, some can get too much data (Over-fetching), some\nnot enough (Under-fetching). There are also versioning, changing schemas. What if there's a way\nto call just once, and have it fetch everything you need, and nothing else? And also strongly typed schema. So, GraphQL was born.\n\nIn the CQRS design pattern (Controller → Service → Repository → Database), GraphQL would sit in the\nController. GraphQL schema consists of \\{ query, mutation \\}. In each, there are resolvers, or functions\nthat perform specific actions. Think of it like a route in a controller.\nFor query, it's getting data. For mutation, it's changing them.\nAt least that's the general concept. Resolvers could do pretty much anything like a normal function,\nas long as you return a type.\n\nHere are two videos that I found helpful explaining GraphQL.\n\n\u003cDoubleYtEmbed vid1=\"eIQh02xuVw4\" vid2=\"Zg4XIpnLWQg\"\u003e\u003c/DoubleYtEmbed\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9:T9f4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"A major task I was given this week was to figure out why pgAdmin wasn't working.\nSo that task was on the high-priority list, because without it, our database\nadministrator wouldn't be able to work. While investigating the problem, I ran\ninto these errors:\n```\nFile \"/usr/lib64/python3.9/random.py\", line 61, in \u003cmodule\u003e\nfrom _sha512 import sha512 as _sha512\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sha512'\n```\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n```\nFile \"/usr/lib64/python3.9/random.py\", line 64, in \u003cmodule\u003e\nfrom hashlib import sha512 as _sha512\nFile \"/usr/lib64/python3.9/hashlib.py\", line 77, in \u003cmodule\u003e\nimport _hashlib\nImportError: /lib64/libcrypto.so.3: version `OPENSSL_3.4.0' not found (required by /usr/lib64/python3.9/lib-dynload/_hashlib.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)\n```\nThere was something preventing mod_wsgi, which is an Apache module for running Python web apps,from\nrunning. At first thought, it was incompatible OpenSSL version with the server. I checked, and we had\nversion 3.5. Maybe somebody updated it recently and it caused problems. But that can't be verified.\nI also tried importing the library by hand using the command below. It was working fine.\n```\npython3 -c 'from hashlib import sha512 as _sha512;print(\"OK\")'\n```\nAnother way to test it was to run a test script through Apache, testssl.wsgi:\n```\nimport sys\nimport platform\ntry:\n    import ssl\n    ssl_info = ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION\nexcept Exception as e:\n    ssl_info = f\"FAILED: {e}\"\n\ndef application(environ, start_response):\n    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type','text/plain')])\n    return [\n        f\"Python version: {platform.python_version()}\\n\".encode(),\n        f\"Python executable: {sys.executable}\\n\".encode(),\n        f\"SSL: {ssl_info}\\n\".encode(),\n    ]\n```\nIt also failed right at the ssl part. A check using `ldd /usr/lib64/python3.9/lib-dynload/_hashlib*.so`\nrevealed that it was using libcrypto.so.3, which linked to /lib64/libcrypto.so.3. *libcrypto* is\nhow Python gets its hash algorithms, and it is loading fine otherwise, but not inside Apache.\n\nI was considering reinstalling Python 3. But it was too drastic as it would affect *everything*\ninside the OS. A lot of services depends on Python and it is working fine, except for this\nApache incident. So I was left with two more options:\n- Reinstall mod_wsgi\n- Use Gunicorn to run pgAdmin, which is reversed proxy from Apache\nI worked with the sysadmin to get a snapshot of the system before proceeding. I reinstalled mod_wsgi,\nand wouldn't you know it? It worked flawlessly again.

The first one, I fried some Spam and egg tofu. You have to try it, it's\ndelicious, fatty. But I had to use a nonstick pan because of the tofu. Fry the egg tofu long enough,\nit became crunchy like an actual fried egg. Spam when fried gave out a savory, tasty new flavor.\n\nThe second one was the leftover stew with roasted drumsticks. I discovered that frying or roasting meat imparts that browned flavor to the protein, called the *Maillard reaction*. It tasted great, even as leftover. It's even better if you save some of the browned liquid from the roast for the soup.\n\n\u003cGallery imgs={['/images/blog/Cooking/25/251211/jjigae2.jpg','/images/blog/Cooking/25/251211/jjigae1.jpg']} /\u003e\n\nThis one was the Hamburg steak I fried with my stainless steel.

I think\nthese frozen pizzas should be baked in a toaster oven instead of an air fryer, because an air fryer would dry the outer part of the pizza before it cooks the cheese.\n\n\u003cGallery imgs={['/images/blog/Cooking/25/251126/pizza1.jpg','/images/blog/Cooking/25/251126/pizza2.jpg','/images/blog/Cooking/25/251126/pizza3.jpg']} /\u003e\n\nThis pizza baked pretty quickly, only took 10 minutes. And it tasted...alright. It was a thin curst, but I can clearly tasted the tomato sauce. But only a hint of cheese, despite tons of cheese on top.\nThe best part was that the pizza *was not* salty like Domino's pizza. So that's a big win for me.\nMaybe if I'm craving for a pizza, a frozen one might be the fix. I might try out the pizza dough \nnext time, since I have a toaster oven.d:T7b2,This is my first official recipe on this blog. It is a request from a good friend of mine.\nHe loves the chicken rice because it is rich, fragment. This is a dish often served during\nspecial occasions in Vietnam, usually ancestor worship day every month. I want to write\nthis recipe with no precise measurement, like Uncle Roger often says: \"Use feeling\".\n\n## Ingredients:\n- Dried Jasmine rice\n- Chicken broth\n- Chicken fat\n- Gingers (optional)\n- Spring onions / Scallions (optional)\n\n![](/images/blog/Cooking/25/251123/image.jpg)\n\u003ccenter\u003eChicken rice with stir-fried beef and spaghetti squash soup\u003c/center\u003e\n\n## Directions:\n- Make enough rice for how many people going to eat the rice. Put the dried Jasmine rice in a bowl,\npot. Make sure it's a separate one from the rice cooker pot. The rice cooker pot usually has a\nnon-stick surface, and we don't want that surface to be scratched up from washing rice.\n- Wash the dried rice 3 times. The water doesn't"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," have to be completely clear.\n- Put the washed rice in the rice cooker pot. No water in the rice pot for now.\n- Put enough chicken broth to cover the rice up to **one** finger joint. The chicken broth can\nbe from canton or freshly made. For freshly made, boiling or steaming some chicken drumsticks\ngives you chicken broth, and meat as well to go with that rice.\n- Add a teaspoon of chicken fat. Chicken fat is a bit harder to get. I usually render the fat\nfrom chicken thighs' skins beforehand. You wouldn't believe just how much fat there is in\nthose thighs here in the US. That's industrial chickens for you, 4 quarters yield enough fat\nfor me to use for two weeks.\n- Add the aromatics. This one is optional. For today, I added some crushed gingers and spring onions.\n- Cook the rice in the rice cooker normally.\n- After 25 - 35 minutes, out comes the perfectly cooked chicken rice.\n\nThis recipe can be used to make delicious chicken sticky rice, too. We did that a lot in Vietnam.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving, everybody.e:T551,Recently I got an assignment that needs to use Docker. Usually it can be done with command\nline, but a lot of time, I use Portainer for the convenience. But today, I wasn't able\nto access my local Docker environment. It kept saying \"the environment named local is unreachable\".\nI discovered that an update to Docker version 29 introduced [breaking changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/29/):\n```\nThe daemon now requires API version 1.44 or later (Docker v25.0+).\n```\nA user named *JoynalFrametOlimpo* at this Github [issue](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/12925) showed me a way to downgrade the API version 1.41 by changing `/etc/docker/daemon.json`\n```\n{\n    \"min-api-version\": \"1.41\",\n    [Other settings down here...]\n}\n```\nAfterwards, it just `systemctl restart docker.service` and Portainer worked again. Keep in mind\nthat I ran an older version of Portainer, 2.27.9 LTS, because I hate the UI change of the\n[new versions](https://docs.portainer.io/release-notes#release-2.32.0-sts).

[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)\nis faster (not using much CPU), use Vulkan as the backend for inference so cross compatible with the Intel\nintegrated GPU (although you can compile one with CUDA in mind).\n\nI tested llama.cpp using various backends:\n\n\u003cTable data={{\n    'headers': ['Backend','Tokens/s'],\n    'rows': [\n        ['CPU only (i7-9750H)', 5],\n        ['Intel UHD Graphics 630 (Vulkan)', 2],\n        ['Nvidia Geforce GTX 1660 Ti (Vulkan)', 32],\n        ['Nvidia Geforce GTX 1660 Ti (CUDA)', 37],\n    ]\n}}\u003e\u003c/Table\u003e\n\nLooks like CUDA surpassed Vulkan.

Just stick to Vulkan.\n\nWhile toying with an OCR(Optical character recognition) model, [LightOnOCR](https://huggingface.co/noctrex/LightOnOCR-1B-1025-GGUF),\nI came up with an idea. What if I can do my homework on paper, then have a model transcribe into text on the computer?\nBut taking pictures and passing through the chat window is a lot of work.Maybe if there exists a specific page\nto do one thing. So I got to work for my idea, ocr-web. I whipped up a Dockerfile from ubuntu, got\n[llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) to download a model in the container.\nIf I ran llama.cpp at this moment, it would only use CPU.\n\nFollowing online guides on how to get Nvidia GPU working with Docker, I installed\n[the container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)\nfrom Nvidia. and ran the demo:\n```\nsudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi\n```\nSuccessful. It printed the graphics card and the percentage in use.\n\nNext, I went to get it working on Docker Compose. I followed [this](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/gpu-support/)\nguide, but it was out of date in `capabilities` part. Still I used it in the beginning. And llama.cpp couldn't find\nany GPU. If I put\n```\ndevices:\n    - /dev/dri:/dev/dri\n```\nin, llama.cpp would find the Intel GPU. The Nvidia Container Toolkit was installed, nvidia-smi found the GPU, but\nllama.cpp couldn't find the Nvidia GPU. This was after I already installed `libvulkan1`.\n\nI installed `vulkan-tools` and used `vulkaninfo | vi -` to find out what happened. It only found LLVM as GPU0, which\nis software-based Vulkan, but no Nvidia. ChatGPT suggested adding `runtime: nvidia` to the Compose yaml.\nPreviously after running the Docker Compose yaml, I would recreate the container with that runtime in\nthe setting. Now Docker Compose would deploy with `nvidia` runtime in mind, but still not work.\n\nThere was a part inside the container toolkit's page I hadn't read, [Specialized Configurations with Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/docker-specialized.html).\nThe page showed many things missing from the Docker page. `capabilities` now is `[graphics]` to use Vulkan. I tried\n`capabilities: all` but it just got an error from Docker Compose. I also added\n`NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all`, `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all`. Still not working as llama.cpp refused to see the\ndedicated GPU (Nvidia).\n\nAnother suggestion from ChatGPT was using `vulkaninfo | grep \"GPU id\"`. So I did, and got this result:\n```\nERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : libXext.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : loader_icd_scan: Failed loading library associated with ICD JSON libGLX_nvidia.so.0.

I added that library into the Docker Compose file. After that, this was the\nnew result:\n```\nERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : loader_scanned_icd_add: Could not get 'vkCreateInstance' via 'vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr' for ICD libGLX_nvidia.so.0\nERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : loader_scanned_icd_add: Could not get 'vkCreateInstance' via 'vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr' for ICD libGLX_nvidia.so.0\n'DISPLAY' environment variable not set... skipping surface info\nerror: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is invalid or not set in the environment.\n                GPU id = 0 (llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits))\n                GPU id = 0 (llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits))\n                GPU id = 0 (llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits))\n                GPU id = 0 (llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits))\n```\nSo, almost there. Just a bit more. For this error, ChatGPT suggested looking for `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json`.\nAnd for some stupid reason, it didn't exist in the container, so I had to map it from the host in readonly mode. Of course,\ndidn't work. This time, Chat said that file referenced OpenGL, not Vulkan. It kept calling out `libnvidia-vulkan.so.1`,\neven if I combed through my host machine to find it. It didn't exist, but ran Vulkan fine. Typical **hallucination**.\n\nUp to Google. Now, searching `libnvidia-vulkan.so.1`, I found this [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74965945/vulkan-is-unable-to-detect-nvidia-gpu-from-within-a-docker-container-when-using)\non Stack Overflow. It led to [this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit/issues/16) Github issue. Seems\nto be a common problem. But there was no solution. Undaunted, I searched once more, this time `docker ERROR: [Loader Message] Code 0 : loader_scanned_icd_add: Could not get 'vkCreateInstance' via 'vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr' for ICD libGLX_nvidia.so.0`.\nThen there was a Github issue about [this problem](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit/issues/191).\nWe were once again getting somewhere. The container was missing `libegl1` library. \nAfter installing this library, perfecto. The container recognized Nvidia GPU.\n```\n'DISPLAY' environment variable not set... skipping surface info\nerror: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is invalid or not set in the environment.\n                GPU id = 0 (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti)\n                GPU id = 1 (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti)\n                GPU id = 2 (llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits))\n```\nNow why did the container need EGL? According to Nvidia forum [moderator](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/minimal-docker-vulkan-offscreen-setup/242883):\n```\nFor any kind of rendering, even headless or off-screen rendering, you will need to have a render context,\nwhich is provided for example by EGL, not GLX. GLX are just GL extensions to be able to use X11 at all.\n- MarkusHoHo\n```\nAh. I should have paid more attention to my Graphics class.\n\nWhile testing llama-cli inside Docker, I ran into another problem. Turns out llama-cpp uses OpenMP, even with using\nVulkan as the backend for inference. `ldd libggml-cpu-haswell.so` revealed that it need libgomp.so.1, which is in libgomp1\nlibrary, as in this [issue](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/14691).\n\nIn summary:\n- ChatGPT is only your first diagnostic. It alone is not enough. You still need Stack Overflow, Github issue, Google, too.\nBut LLMs are good for brainstorming. *Trust, but verify*.\n- This entire wild goose chase would have never happened if it was mentioned at all in Nvidia official guide (libegl1).\nStupid. While Intel/AMD GPU, I just imported /dev/dri + libvulkan1 = Worked deliciously.\n- Now I know why people hate Nvidia Closed-source driver."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:Tb45,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I have a dream. That I, one day, shall have my own ChatGPT. Because after being an avid user since 2023, it has\nbeen so slow and laggy. Not like many people, I hold no emotional attachment to ChatGPT models, only its uses\nand effectiveness. Despite its overtly cherry nature, ChatGPT 4 and 4o represented the best OpenAI has to offer\nin terms of speed and accuracy. Those reasoning models have never been appealing to me. They are just models reiterating their\nown answers over and over again. These are \"souped up\" chatbots, no reasoning capability. And sometimes I just\nneed a quick answer. Right or wrong, ChatGPT always gives me a starting point. They make great rubber ducks to iterate\nideas with. Even since OpenAI \"upgrades\" to version 5, ChatGPT has become sluggish. It is not more correct, nor faster\nthan previous models. They even disabled your ability to switch models. Like bro, I don't need a chatbot to spend\na minute coming up with an answer. Just give me something to start.\n\nI looked at some ways to run LLMs locally before. But I was turned off by how much VRAM they need to run big models\nlike gpt-oss. And then, something randomly clicked yesterday. Pretty sure I just searched something randomly, as \nalways. And I came across [ollama](https://ollama.com/library). There are models that are much smaller than the\nbig boy gpt-oss. Like the deepseek-r1:8b, or the gemma3:4b. The 8b stands for billion parameters. The bigger the number, \nthe more accurate the output, but also the larger the size. So these two models fit perfectly in my 6GB GTX 1660 Ti.\nAnd the ollama is easy to install and use. I chose the manual installation method: download an archive and run its binary.\nIts interface is reminiscent of Docker. So just `ollama serve \u0026` first to create a server. Then `ollama pull \u003cmodel\u003e`\nand `ollama run \u003cmodel\u003e` and you are good.\n\nI read some online posts on Reddit, [r/LocalLLaMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/).

I use ollama because it's easy to get your feet wet, like Docker\nbefore learning Kubernetes. ollama loses out to llama.cpp in terms of performance, functions. There are\n[beefs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/11714#issuecomment-3172893576) between the two applications.\nIf I ever decided to get serious about this running local GPT seriously, I will consider llama.cpp. Or vllm like\n[this guy](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1opa6os/local_setup/).\n\nOther than that, I am just happy to have my own DIY GPT.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cQuote \n\tquote={\"This content was not written, nor helped written, by ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, or any of the LLMs. Viewer discretion is advised.\"}\n/\u003e"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T55d,I have been thinking. Let's say there are chicken drumsticks:\n- If I marinate an entire drumstick, it will only penetrate the outer layer of the meat. The inside would still be\nnormal chicken flavor, unsalted.\n- If I cut the drumsticks to many small pieces, the marinate can go through. But that is a lot of work, and not\neasy to store in frozen bags. I usually store the drumsticks in whole, at least they stick as drumsticks, easy\nto defrost later. If I store a bag of chicken pieces, they will clump together, making them hard to defrost,\nespecially in microwave as they can be cooked through before defrost.\n\nSo I came up with an idea. Studying Chinese cooking techniques, I saw that they cook meat, vegetables, anything\nthat takes a while to cook first. Then those are put aside to make the sauce. So I did just that. I cooked the meat\nfirst, whether is cut or whole, in an air fryer. Separately, on the stovetop, I heated up a pan, made a sauce\nout of oyster sauce, some chilli and paprika. Then I **basted** the sauce on top of cooked meat, as in putting\nthe meat in the pan, pouring the cooked sauce on with a spoon. This is like basting a steak. Then meat went back to the air fryer to finish cooking. Voila, no different than cooking everything on a pan. What's more, cooking in an air fryer feels less oily on food, food is less dried I think.\n\nSo give it a try.12:T4be,I have been eating a lot of Panda Express for lunch because it's cheap. $10, 1 chicken breast, 1 something saucy,\nrice, vegetables. I also enjoy the Beijing beef and Orange chicken. But now I found a few references on how they\nare made. It's literally \"battered chicken in sugar sauce\", so is the beef dish. But I do like their idea of\ncutting AGAINST the grain, using a bit of baking soda for tenderness, using cornstarch (and maybe egg whites, too)\nto prevent the meat from drying out in high-heat cooking. I also learned to utilize some vinegar for citrusy\nflavor, because as I learned from [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/@ChineseCoo"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"kingDemystified)\nand looking at a lot of sauce bottles, they all shared a lot of common ingredients: water, sugar for sweetness,\nwhite vinegar for sourness, flavor (some fruit extract, tomato paste, oyster extract), salt (or soy sauce if Chinese\nsauce), thickener (corn starch, xanthan gum).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/nM1GQNJU6LQ](https://www.youtube.com/embed/nM1GQNJU6LQ)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fU6MCPZ2M](https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-fU6MCPZ2M)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/zc63e7ZKUrg](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zc63e7ZKUrg)13:T1745,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"In recent times, I have a chance to collaborate on a major project that powers a major state. It is a great \nopportunity, because I can see how my skill once again be used in the real world. However, I didn't realize\nthat this was a PHP project. No worry, though. Just another language to pick up.\n\nWorking with this language, I came to some impressions of my own. \n\nSome positives:\n- I like that this was created to look like C++. So anyone writing in C++ can feel at ease with the language.\n- Any change to a php file can be reflected right back. There's no compiling, no reset needed. You just type\nthe same php file into the browser, or F5. And it will run with the new code.\n\nNow on to the negatives. Don't worry, there are plenty:\n- I HATE C++. I dabbled in both C and C++. While malloc, pointer-in-pointer are something we all tripped over \nourselves, C is something I consider a beautiful language. Easy to grasp, understand, nice syntax. C++ came\naround with dumb stuff like `::`, making it hard to read, which PHP then learned from. Java, annoying as it is\nto write, uses `.` instead. I wish kids are taught C instead of Python, or Pascal in my days (close enough to C but\nuseless in real-life). They would understand more of how computer actually runs, data structures, memory management.\n- It's hard to debug. Normally when you type `echo 'hi'`, it will print to the browser. What happens when I don't\nwant to print to the browser, then? There is no `printf` to the console. So later I found out about error_log,\nwhich does something akin to printf or console.log on Javascript. So I guess it's bearable. But I have to dig\nfor it. `var_dump` can be used to dump the entire object, at least that is neat.\n- PHP is similar to a scripting language. Not like scripting Python, Javascript. More like bash of Linux,\nbatch of Windows. Each php run, each access is a fresh start. It's stateless, so they have to import classes,\nlibrary, configuration again. Not like other long-lived languages, frameworks. That's why POST with input value\nis important, as they have states to give the server.\n- Most languages and frameworks I know connect to a database through a series of connections called a pool. These\nare reusable, so any query doesn't have to re-establish a connection to a database. But since PHP is NOT \na long-lived language, it has to do such a thing. So mysqli only has 1 connection. No connection pool so no multi query. It will block if query. Even with MYSQLI_ASYNC. **Once you start an async query on a connection, the connection is busy until you call reap_async_query().** So it's NOT EVEN truly asynchronous, because there's no second connection to use unless \nyou make a new one.\n- Any long query, you have to make sure there is still response back to the browser, otherwise the HTTP server (those are\nApache and Nginx for anyone speaking software) will drop the connection. Here something I do while branstorming ideas\non improving a long procedure:  \n\n```\n$this-\u003econn-\u003equery($sql, MYSQLI_ASYNC);\n$allconn = [$this-\u003econn];\n$errors = $reject = [];\n// Poll the database every 30 seconds\nwhile (!mysqli_poll($allconn, $errors, $reject, 0, 30)) {\n\t// Print something to prevent timeout\n\techo \";\";\n\n\t// Force PHP to send output immediately, or else if the server holds onto buffer, it timeouts\n\tif (ob_get_level()) ob_flush();\n\tflush();\n\n\t// Always reset this array, it will be empty once mysqli_poll returns []\n\t$allconn = [$this-\u003econn];\n}\n```\nI don't expect this to be completely correct. After all, I thought of this while brainstorming. It didn't work, of course.\nI couldn't access any other pages of that site, unless I was on another device.  \nI just wish any long process would just be turned into a worker/background job, with a table to monitor it. So it doesn't\nhang the entire site like that.\n- Someone thought it is good to COPY an entire object in a foreach loop. This is by [design](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8769288/php-ampersand-before-the-variable-in-foreach-loop). How fun!\n```\nforeach ($objs as $obj) {\n    $obj.a = 2; // Actual $objs[i].a is still the original value\n}\n\nforeach ($objs as \u0026$obj) {\n    $obj.a = 2; // Actual $objs[i].a is still now 2\n}\nvar_dump($obj); // Important gotcha with this is that the loop variable is leaked outside the loop scope\n// unset the reference afterward!\nunset($obj);\n\n```\nThere is one more thing I found but unrelated to PHP language as a whole. Someone would write a JSON into a\ndiv's attribute and htmlspecialchars it. So they can JSON.parse the element's value. I failed to see the reason\nbehind this move. Just write the JSON normally the first time around would have been better.\n\nRants over. All in all, unless I use a cheap PHP hosting, like [infinityfree.com](https://www.infinityfree.com/) to\nwrite backend or something, I wouldn't be using this language. Python, though slower, is still more maintainable \nthan this language.\n\nTo be fair, as I learned from many posts such as [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ekuzmt/cmv_languageframework_performance_doesnt_matter/), [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1fnvavy/do_efficient_programming_languages_matter_for_web/), [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/aaxjft/in_an_average_web_app_what_part_of_it_is_usually/), most performance issues from a website or web app are database\nproblems (lack of index, lousy queries), questionable design choices for frontend (UI), backend (logic), \noverloaded Javascript libraries... I like this approach, **avoid premature optimization**. All this talks about\nbuilding scalable services, I don't like. What if your service never reaches 1M users?

Through buying a new [8 inch one](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-722-20-Classic-Stainless-Skillet/dp/B00008CM6A?crid=2JL5NN8RWYXJ1\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FNnQYNXfLoGcUwOk0xo75nzL2GhLyCcrAjytK1nk38c8Grt2KG5rYcAZogL6mQ7XaQ4I95WU0klurPzXou5_R_jCsjA8wSuUtYDOTvRt-I6mvax03wkqn2uYCHo6wA8HCQHRNg9WsXjZgaD-jvHFwoMRNnw0Rwse6B-jsNjYfXieWszDa6k4s6EVHV3atTXApwW2oSmXOw3k8wljFjDUDnncdsTBq6HVkGk-9GIVFFuhtpzEk7S4_vjVm4_B_SFJQ84OzscBRCMxrVLAVZbXtqGhwtzY6fBcsplwkrq6h4o.XUiOccuGHYWQMFYZVc94lKh_0KG77LjgICZu3Tt2f7E\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=8%2Binch%2Bpan\u0026qid=1755802284\u0026sprefix=8%2Binch%2Bpa%2Caps%2C196\u0026sr=8-5\u0026th=1), I have been frying sunny side up\neggs every single day. Each failure, each stuck egg, I learned a bit more:\n- An 8 inch pan has its own benefits. It is smaller than the 10 inch saute pan, meaning if I want to fry something quick, I can just grab the 8 inch instead of 10 inch. One of the drawbacks of stainless steel is you need *quite a bit more oil* than non-stick to prevent sticking. So it's best to have two sizes of pan.\n- Another things I discovered is the [stove](./Cooking/25/250712) would not heat evenly, especially at the center where the heat\nsensor stays. If I cranked it to maximum, it would heat up fast in some spot, but not at the center. So it's not that\nthe stove is weak, or the sensor preventing it running. It was just the dumb design of the heating element.\n\nThe actual steps of frying anything on a stainless steel pan goes as follow:\n- Heat up the pan on medium, medium high for 2-3 minutes. For electric, that is about 1000-1200 watts. Up until you can spray some water to the surface of the pan, and it bounces\naround in little water blob without splitting. If it splits, the pan is too hot. If it forms into larger blobs, the \npan is hot enough.\n- Put some oil so it covers the entire pan's surface. This is where *it takes a bit more oil for stainless steel* comes from. Turn the gas/power down to low. Leave it for 10 seconds so it heats up the oil. Afterwards, hold the pan up and give it a gentle swirl so the oil coats the pan's side wall. This ensures the food won't stick to the side wall of the pan.\n- Put the food in and start frying. **DO NOT** lift the food or touch it after putting it on the pan. Leave it. After about 1 minute, **then** lift it slowly. Because it has created a crisp, cooked layer underneath, the food will be easy\nto be lifted up with a spatula. If not, leave it a bit longer.\n\nThis works for any food, *except* eggs. If I beat up the eggs to make scrambled eggs, or omelette, it's fine. If it's\nsunny side eggs, then it *will* stick. So I learn another way from [Chef Joshy](https://www.youtube.com/@chefjoshyjin/):\n- Put oil in pan, then heat the pan up until the oil smokes. You should put *just* enough oil to cover the pan, because later, we can dump the *seasoned* oil.\n- Dump the old oil. Then apply some more oil to cool the pan a bit. Turn the gas/power down to low. This is the new oil to cook eggs with. Leave it for 10 seconds so it heats up the oil. Also afterwards, hold the pan up and give it a gentle swirl so the oil coats the pan's side wall.\n- Then put an egg in. **DO NOT** lift the egg or touch it after putting it on the pan. After about 1 minute, **then** lift it slowly. It should not stick, at least it creates a crust below the egg.\n\n![](/images/blog/Cooking/25/250821/20250815_143230.jpg)\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ccenter\u003eReferences:\u003c/center\u003e\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs6DXZMKVZs?si=WGi70rdorTgWQ_RM](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs6DXZMKVZs?si=WGi70rdorTgWQ_RM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cSYhLbIA4I?si=KPBC0Xut6G0bRBmK](https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cSYhLbIA4I?si=KPBC0Xut6G0bRBmK)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPtE2QEzvbo?si=77PxCyofTrJKcjK9](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPtE2QEzvbo?si=77PxCyofTrJKcjK9)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"16:T498,I just finished my 1-week job at a vet school. I was to guide and supervise the next generation of would-be veterinarians,let's call them \"ensigns\" like in TNG. They got to see if they cut out to be a vet. It was an easy gig. Free room, 3 meals a day, hot shower, laundry, a piano downstair. Few dollars to take home as payment. A few surprises, mostly happiness and fun. Most surprises came from me showing up at random times, helping out other staff with keeping an eye on things, or showing new attendees around. Everyone was really hardworking, attentive, more than I could. One moment stood out to me.\n\nIt was when we finished eating dinner, heading back to the dorm. But seeing that a lot of \"ensigns\" were bored, we decided to go to the football field. A lot of them played, some just enjoyed the scenery, the grass, the air. I was pleasantly surprised. Normally, I would have loved to spend time indoor, I thought everyone would just stick their heads to their phones. But that goes to show that life can still surprise you. Shows that there is still hope for the future.\n\nThey even made thank-you cards for every one of the staff.

It is not much different from back home.\nMy family switched to electric a while back, because somehow it cooks faster. But something I realized a while back, only\nmade clearer recently. As I got my hands on a portable hot place of 1000W, I compared cooking my food using the range vs\nthe hob. And somehow the hob won, even though the electric stove was supposed to have much more (power)[https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-ENERGY-STAR-30-Free-Standing-Electric-Range-JBS360RTSS]. It was 1000W vs 1250W and 2400W.\nThen how come a hob can make 1L of soup in 3 minutes, while it took 10 minutes to do the same on the small burner of \nthe big stove.\n\nLooking at the specification of the stove, I noticed these words. Sensi-temp technology, Temp Limiting Coil. Turns out\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"the electric stove has these sensors in the middle of the burner to detect when a pan or pot is overheat. Main problem\nis, as a LOT of people have brought up from [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/bbgmi2/sensi_temp_coil_burner_is_messing_with_my_cooking/) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84pYbdTi_IE),\nit causes the burner to not work as well as intended. Food not getting hot fast enough, burner still causes danger\nWHEN THERE IS NO POT on top. It got to the point where a mini hob of 1000 watts can beat it in its own game.\n\nThis is a function designed for people who either don't know how to cook, or careless when cooking to the point \nof leaving the burner running while distracting. Cater to the lowest denominator. This just ends up frustrating\nactual cooks everywhere because of idiots ruining it for everybody.18:T7e2,Back at my early web dev years, I didn't like .NET Core. It was mainly because of the new things I have never heard of.\nWhat was dependency injection? It felt like magic behind the framework. \n\nThis is my effort to explain what dependency injection is, from .NET Core. So normally, to use a class, you would \ninstantiate one using new.\n```\npublic class ReportService {\n    private readonly EmailSender _emailSender;\n\n    public ReportService() {\n        _emailSender = new EmailSender(); // hard-coded dependency\n    }\n\n    public void SendReport() {\n        _emailSender.Send(\"report.pdf\");\n    }\n}\n```\nBy using DI, you don't have to instantiate a class everytime you need to use it. They will be instantiated once at the\nbeginning and passed along in a container.\n```\nservices.AddScoped\u003cIEmailSender, EmailSender\u003e();\nservices.AddScoped\u003cReportService\u003e();\n\n// Then injected by the framework\npublic class ReportService {\n    private readonly IEmailSender _emailSender;\n\n    public ReportService(IEmailSender emailSender) {\n        _emailSender = emailSender; // dependency is passed in (injected)\n    }\n\n    public void SendReport() {\n        _emailSender.Send(\"report.pdf\");\n    }\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"}\n```\nThis makes the code more modular, testable, flexible, and maintainable. The main case I found for this is for testing,\nwhen you need to replace the service with a testing one. Another one is easier to maintain, since you don't run\naround, make new classes anymore.\n\nIt makes things difficult in the beginning, because it creates a \"Where is this coming from?\" effect—harder to trace what's actually being used. DI often encourages interfaces, which adds complexities to code. But it's necessary to learn\nas this is Inversion of Control (IoC), a fundamental design principle where the control flow of a program is inverted.\nYou don’t create dependencies yourself — they're provided to you by the framework. In this instance from .NET Core:\n- You register dependencies in a container.\n- The framework resolves and injects them.19:T66a,Today I'm attempting to cook rice \"again\" in a pot. The last time I tried this, it was mushy, sticky, impossible to clean\nout of a nonstick pot (by the way, I realized slowly that nonstick pot is a stupid idea. Best setup is nonstick pan/ steel pot).\nThis time, I got a brand new idea. Most likely recycling from how rice cooker cooks rice. So a rice cooker cooks rice at a\nconstant heat source. For my Aroma rice cooker, it was 300 watts. So I tried cooking the rice at level 3 of my stove in\nthe apartment, because in an experiment I did earlier, level 3 was comparable to my rice cooker when both were boiling\nwater. After 25 minutes (cause the stove had to heat up a bit), it was done. I tasted some and it was a bit mushy, but\noverall, solid. It was better than my previous attempt with the cooking method of the Internet: boil then steam at low\nburner level.\n\nWith maybe less water, this could work. Of course, I could try with either boiling water, or doing a hybrid: boil, then smaller at level 3, so it boils off the water AND the rice absorps some of it. \n\nThe pot is still a pain to clean, though. Maybe soaking it with warm water for a bit is better.\n\nThe second time I tried today, I cooked"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1," it with level 4 burner.

Maybe just my feeling, but a bit more water, 5 more minutes in heat\nwould have helped.\n\n![gallery](/images/blog/Cooking/25/250701-2/20250701_112055.jpg,/images/blog/Cooking/25/250701-2/20250701_192855.jpg)1a:T546,This is an update on my journey towards understanding stainless steel pans.\n\nI got myself a steel pan last week.

It's like a perfect well-rounded \"potpan\" I can use for anything.\nThis thing reminded me so much of the pot I used when I first got to the US. It was a big electric pot I used for \neverything as well. I was living in the dorm, so cooking was limited. And I couldn't go downstair to use the kitchen\nbecause it was too far. So I used a big and a small electric pot for everything. That means the big one was also a pan.\nI fried eggs in that. Because there were only two heat settings, I had to be careful to not burn the eggs. Was a fun\ntime, and really pushing my creativity in terms of storage, resource management and making use of what you have.\n\nBut I digress. I fried eggs yesterday by trying the old method. It was just medium temperature, adding oil in, and\nfrying the eggs. Granted, using this way, I had to baby the eggs to make sure they don't stick and burn. And they get \nburned easily. But I still managed to make it look good.\n\nI guess I need some more practice, more understanding.

Unlike a real piece of Brie, it did not have a rind and a middle creamy\ncheese. Instead, it was a uniform gray cheese. Slicing a piece for testing, it tasted tangy, salty, had a hint of cheese\nand fermentation smell. So of course it tasted nothing like Brie, it was more \"Cheddar\" clone because of how salty it is.\nI guess the salt is to cover up the fact this is not a cheese. I tried various vegetarian dishes in the past. A lot\nof those used lots of salt and spices to cover up the vegetable flavor, too. I would appreciate it if they just not\nadd so much salt.\n\n![gallery](/images/blog/Cooking/25/250620/20250624_134528.jpg,/images/blog/Cooking/25/250620/20250624_135816.jpg)\n\nComing to the US, I realized there is a market for vegan dairy product like cheese.

I also\nI also added multiprocessing support for this program, cause let me tell you, when one match could last up to 10\nhours. So long, I later added a stop early flag to break the game, and that long game was with multiprocessing.\nThe multiprocessing is to distribute the games out to many cores, so each CPU core plays one game. The reason for\nmultiprocessing and not multithreading is because this program is written in Python, thus subjected to Global\nInterpreter Lock (GIL). \n\nA bug my partner found was that Python could not find WEIGHTS in MinimaxPlayer, the class for the Minimax algorithm.\nNow, this wouldn't be funny if my code didn't work on my side, but it did still work. There was no error. He said\nit only happened when he used multiprocessing mode. I also knew that he used Windows and I used Linux. So I got to\nwork. The function to import json in as weights for MinimaxPlayer was supposed to import weights in a static\nvariable for MinimaxPlayer, so that those weights can be available to any MinimaxPlayer declared.\n\nNormally, Python’s multiprocessing.Pool creates separate processes, which do not share memory or class-level state. In the main process, the child processes (used by starmap) won’t inherit that WEIGHTS value. But WEIGHTS is a static variable\nin MinimaxPlayer, that should mean it sticks through new processes, right? I found out that on Windows, the\nmultiprocessing module uses **spawn**. This means:\n\n- Each subprocess starts from scratch by re-importing the module.\n- Nothing from global scope (like class variables, or initialized data) is automatically inherited.\n- Class-level MinimaxPlayer.WEIGHTS doesn’t exist unless explicitly initialized in each subprocess.\n\nBy contrast, on Linux/macOS, multiprocessing uses **fork**, which copies memory from the parent process, including class-level state — that’s why it “just works” there.\n\nNow understanding the issue, it is easy to fix. Make WEIGHTS global in the main file, then pass it in MinimaxPlayer\nwhen creating a new object.\n\nThis bug **highlights** the difference in OS architecture between Windows and Unix. In **fork** in Unix, the child process \nis a copy of the parent process (using copy-on-write), while **spawn** in Windows means starting a fresh, clean process.\nIf my friend hadn't use Windows to test, we wouldn't have caught the bug, considering its elusiveness."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1e:Ta4d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Lately, between trying to survive error-correcting class and feed myself without killing my digestion,\nI didn't have as much time to write blog.

So they use [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan) instead. That's where DXVK\nand VKD3D. These libraries translate API calls from DirectX to Vulkan, which helps games that can't run on Wine on\nits default DirectX libraries.  \n\nJust download the libraries from the links, then copy the DLL files d3d11.dll, dxgi.dll, d3d12.dll, d3d12_core.dll\nto the *system32* folder of your *Wine* folder. For instance,\n```\n/home/ubuntu/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32\n```\nsimilar to Windows folder structure.  \n\nAfter that, open the terminal and type *winecfg*.

But I don't want my server to fully commit to that idea.\nEven though Proxmox seems like a decent OS for the job, I still pick Debian for more customization. It's more\ngeneral-purpose compared to dedicated OS. There's only one package that can help me realize the dream, *Cockpit*.\n\n[Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) is a web interface for managing a server. It comes with many plugins that can be \ninstalled separately. I planned to use this for managing virtual machines, because this is the only application\nwith a UI to do so.\n\n#### Installing\nQuite easy if you're on Debian or Ubuntu. Just type\n```\nsudo apt install cockpit cockpit-machines\n```\nIt will automatically install *Cockpit* along with VM plugin and other dependencies.\n\n#### Quick look\nAccess the Cockpit UI through address [https://your.ip:9090/](https://your.ip:9090/). Your username and password\nis your current account.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241019/1.jpg)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241019/2.jpg)\n\nWhen you first log in, the account will be assigned *Limited access*, meaning it does not have *sudo* access.\nYou need to [escalate](https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/privileges.html) to *Administrative access*\nif you want more functionalities.\n\n#### Creating virtual machines\nNow, this is the hard part. I tried getting it work in the past and didn't end well. With a new server, I intended to\ndo it again. Maybe this time it would work.  \nAnyway, this is not a comprehensive guide, I got it working but I will try to retrace my steps and record them for\nfuture references.\n\n[These parts are referenced from this article.](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation)  \nFirst, run this command to make sure VT-x (Intel) or AMD-V (AMD) is enabled in BIOS.\n```\nkvm-ok\n```\nIf it says **INFO: /dev/kvm exists** then you can proceed.  \nSecond, add your own user into group *kvm* and *libvirt*.\n```\nsudo adduser `id -un` kvm\nsudo adduser `id -un` libvirt\n```\n\nNext, I need to set up a storage pool. In Cockpit, a storage pool makes sense for hard drives, not really for disk\nimages, because they would ask you to show them the *location* of the ISO file, regardless of it belonging in the pool.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241019/3.jpg)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241019/4.jpg)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241019/5.jpg)\n\nWhen it asks you what type of connection, there are two types. These also show up when creating a virtual machine (VM).\nThe two types are system and user session:\n\n**System**\n- Ideal for server VMs\n- VM will launch with root permissions\n- Ideal networking support\n- Permissions denied for disk images in home directories\n\n**User session**\n- Good choice for desktop virtualization\n- VM launched with unprivileged limited access, with the process and PTY owned by your user account\n- Restrictions in networking (SLIRP-based emulation) and PCI device assignment\n- Disk images can be stored in user home directory\n\nWhen first starting, I created like one type of pool, and another type of VM. So mix and match, which ended up with the\nVM reporting error about permissions on the drive or images. Even if they both the same type (User session), I still\nreceived some errors about permissions as well. So I consulted [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/issues/996)\nand some solutions worked:\n- Change /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf to make things work. Uncomment user/group to work as root.\n- Copy your ISO images and hard disks to /var/lib/libvirt/images. It only works for *system* VMs.\n- Change permission and owner:group of folder you store disks in using chmod and chown, respectively.\n\nI also adjust Spice and VNC listen address to be 0.0.0.0 by default *in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf*, so I can connect to the VM [remotely](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/issues/73).  \nOne last thing. Make sure the CPU type is **host-passthrough** for the best performance. According to\n[an OpenStack post](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/LibvirtXMLCPUModel), there is a difference between\nhost-model and host-passthrough.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241019/6.jpg)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"23:Tc8b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"One of the most frustrating points of owning Intel laptops, or any laptops, is dealing with\nheat issues. It usually stems from overclocking by the CPU. It's because of \n[Intel Turbo Boost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost). It's a frequency scaler that can\nchange a CPU's frequency to go higher than base clock depending on workload. That's why when you \nsearch for a CPU, there are 2 frequencies, Base Frequency and Turbo Frequency. The Turbo Frequency\nis for 1-core boost, multi-core boost is in lower frequency.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/241018/9750h.png)\n\nIt makes sense on a desktop because we're not limited by battery life or thermal. But when you're on\na laptop, those are the main concern. And a laptop when boosting up, has a tendency to overheat, bad!\nI have seen it reached 99 degree Celsius, even shutting down. So I have an aversion toward using \nTurbo Boost in a laptop and try turning it off. Several ways have been used to disable it.\n\n#### Disable SpeedStep\nThis was my first method with my first laptop. However, it not only disabled the overclock, but also\ndisable frequency scaling completely, which was not ideal but I didn't know at the time. Dynamic frequency\nscaling helps regulate power usage and thermal.\n\n#### The 99%\nMy family had a convertible laptop with an [i5-7200U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/95443/intel-core-i5-7200u-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3-10-ghz.html). It was slow, ran hot as hell, small screen (13 inch) \nand expensive (800USD compared to 500 USD for a normal one). A way to deal with the heat was to go to **Power Options**\nin Control Panel of Windows, click on *Change plan settings* of the current power plan, *Change advanced power settings*.\nAfterward, scroll down to *Processor Power Management*. At *Maximum processor state*, fix On battery (and maybe\nPlugged in) to **99%**. One downside is that you won't be accessing 100% of the CPU power.

I was surprised.\n\nWhen I was still working as a Full Stack Developer for my old place, I\n**hated** their .NET Core codebase. Because at the time, I didn\\'t\nunderstand what MVC was for, and many more intricacies in the underlying\nstructure of their codebase. I often argued with their senior developer\nabout the necessity of such baggage like interface, dependency\ninjection. To this day, I still can\\'t see the reason. Maybe because\nI\\'m ignorant to them, or I don\\'t have the view of the bigger picture,\nas most my web applications are quite small, a simple ExpressJS with a\ncouple of APIs should do it. That\\'s why I was ecstatic when we move on\nto other backend frameworks. My favorite at the time was NestJS. It was\nbuilt upon ExpressJS, so right up my alley. And since a new codebase\nmeant moving on from legacy baggages, no more problems from .NET Core\nhaunting me. Another thing I hated was I couldn\\'t program the .NET\nserver on Linux, I could only use Windows with Visual Studio, a behemoth\nIDE that ate up all of 12GB ram whenever I wanted to debug the program.\nI could never find ways to debug on VS Code, better yet, create a new\n.NET Web API project.

But Jeff Geerling, a Youtuber I\nfollow, posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NJ6V8i1Xd8)\nabout deploying your own VPN to access your server from a remote\nlocation, and I feel like I must write my own experience on the matter.\n\n#### The differences in my approach\n\nAccording to Mr. Geerling, he had a public IP (though not static) and\npointed his domain to this IP to connect to his network using Wireguard\ninstalled by PiVPN. I do not have such luxury, as my public IP is\n10.x.x.x through PPPoE to my ISP, Viettel, so using his way was out of\nthe question. I am stuck in a situation known as CGNAT. What's more, he\nexposed ALL his network out, which, to each of their own, is quite\ndangerous as the VPN can be used as an attack vector to your own\nnetwork. I did a similar thing while creating my own VOIP service using\nAsterisk, but it only lasted a day, and I quickly closed it due to the\ndanger behind it. PiVPN, the tool he used, is quite fascinating and I\nwill look into it in the future. But back when I built my VPN, it was on\na virtual server, and I built it manually. I didn't know any automated\ntool like his, I just followed some guides from DigitalOcean to set up\nWireguard, along with fail2ban, ssh. In fact, the reason I chose\nWireguard was that it was easier to set up. OpenVPN has a lot of moving\nparts needed to run, while Wireguard only requires a pair of keys.\nGranted, there are\n[scripts](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install) that help\ninstall OpenVPN, but the performance is OpenVPN's Achilles's heel. I\nonly have 1 vCPU, so performance is kind of a big deal. Lastly, his\nvideo mentioned \"a little extra security on public Wifi\" and \"bypass\ncontent restriction\". While my VPN can't bypass any content restriction,\nit can provide encryption for my traffic on public Wifi, in addition to\nproviding its own DNS server to speed up DNS query.\n\n#### CGNAT (carrier-grade network address translation)\n\nA blog [post](https://www.draytek.co.uk/information/blog/what-is-cgnat)\non Draytek explains this well, but to quote from a\n[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/hi2sde/i_just_learned_my_internet_connection_is_cgnat_is/)\ncomment as a short version: \"CGNAT means your ISP doesn\\'t have enough\npublic IPv4 addresses to assign one to each user. So they are\nessentially doing to you what your home router does to the Internet by\ngiving you a NAT\\'ed IP address. Yes, that means you can\\'t run your own\nservers or forward traffic at home\". My situation may not technically be\nCGNAT, could be simply double NAT from my end and my ISP's, because my\n\"public\" IP is not in the CGNAT address block, which is usually from\n100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255, is 10.x.x.x. I first noticed this\nphenomenon in 2014, when I installed fiber. Though back then I didn't\nknow how to bridge the ISP router to my TP-Link router, I knew of double\nNAT and opened similar port on both routers to torrent. However, I\nchecked on [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org/) and they couldn't see the open\nport. The torrent could still download, but it couldn't upload. It was\nstrange, because before that, I could see the open port when I was still\non ADSL (also double NAT). It was my biggest achievement back in 8^th^\ngrade, to open port and torrent, or host my own radio using Windows\nMedia Encoder. The second biggest was getting 3D games to run on my\nPentium 4 computer.\n\n#### Setting up virtual server\n\nThere are a lot of options when choosing a virtual server provider. I\nchose Viettel IDC because it was the closest to home, and I also use\ntheir fiber service. I bought 1 vCore with 1GB RAM, 20GB SSD, 300 Mbps\nunlimited bandwidth. I chose Ubuntu Server as the base OS, because I'm\nused to Debian-based OS. I guess the way to choose your preferences\nworks the same in other providers, whether AWS, GCP, Linode\\...\n\nSome steps I performed before setting up WIreguard:\n\n\\- Install ssh to have remote access, instead of using console from\nbrowser. Change ssh port, only allow access with key\n\n\\- Configure firewall using\n[ufw](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-20-04):\nDeny all incoming, allow ssh port, Wireguard port\n\n\\- Install\n[fail2ban](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-fail2ban-works-to-protect-services-on-a-linux-server)\nto limit amount of login attempts\n\n#### Setting up Wireguard\n\nI followed this\n[guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-wireguard-on-ubuntu-20-04)\non how to set up Wireguard Server. First, I generated 2 pairs of keys,\none for the server, one for the client using the commands:\n\n*wg genkey \\| sudo tee /etc/wireguard/private.key*\n\n*sudo cat /etc/wireguard/private.key \\| wg pubkey \\| sudo tee\n/etc/wireguard/public.key*\n\nFollowing that, I had to choose a subnet. Since 192.168.0.x, 1.x are all\ntoo common, I chose anything from 2.x and up. After that, I went to\n*/etc/wireguard/*. I created a config file for my VPN, *wg0.conf*\n\n*\\[Interface\\]*\n\n*Address = 192.168.13.1/24*\n\n*PostUp = ufw allow 51820/udp*\n\n*PostUp = ufw route allow in on wg0*\n\n*PreDown = ufw delete allow 51820/udp*\n\n*PreDown = ufw route delete allow in on wg0*\n\n*ListenPort = 51820*\n\n*PrivateKey = \\\u003cserver private key here\\\u003e*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]*\n\n*PublicKey = \\\u003cclient public key here\\\u003e*\n\n*AllowedIPs = 192.168.13.2/32*\n\n*\\[Interface\\]* is configurations for your own VPN interface, whether\nit's a server or a client. *PostUp* and *PreDown* are commands to run\n*after* turning on the VPN server and *before*\nshutting down server, respectively. I set up a bunch of commands that\nopen port, allow traffic running inside VPN and vice versa when turning\noff server. *\\[Peer\\]* are configurations for clients that will connect\nto the server. Each *\\[Peer\\]* adds another client to the server.\n*AllowedIPs* is where you type in the client's VPN IP address. If the\nclient also acts as a router to another subnet, for instance,\n192.168.0.x, you can add *192.168.0.0/24* and you can access that subnet\nfrom the VPN.\n\nOn my home server, not the virtual one. I also created a config file in\n*/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf*:\n\n*\\[Interface\\]*\n\n*PrivateKey = \\\u003cclient private key here\\\u003e*\n\n*Address = 192.168.13.2/24*\n\n*DNS = 8.8.8.8*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]*\n\n*PublicKey = \\\u003cserver public key here\\\u003e*\n\n*AllowedIPs = 192.168.13.0/24*\n\n*Endpoint = \\\u003cserver real IP\\\u003e:51820*\n\n*PersistentKeepalive = 25*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]* here means something different. For a client to connect to a\nserver, it only needs 1 peer. For *Endpoint*, you need to pinpoint the\nvirtual server's IP address. *PersistentKeepalive* is necessary to keep\nthe connection up, as we are running essentially a tunnel from the\nvirtual server to the real one. If the client isn't a server, that part\nwon't be needed.\n\nOn both servers, I typed in *wg-quick up wg0*. I pinged from each side\nwith the other's IP address and it worked.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/24/240902-1/wireguard_8070_8878.png)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Jeef Geerling - Build your own private WireGuard VPN with\nPiVPN](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/build-your-own-private-wireguard-vpn-pivpn)\n\n\\- [Information about icanhazip.com, you can use ident.me\ninstead](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/06/17/how-a-small-free-ip-tool-survived/)\n\n\\- [ELI5: How does NAT (Network Address Translation)\nwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1wqc30/eli5_how_does_nat_network_address_translation_work/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2b:T18ce,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"It's very nice to have something powerful in a compact form, like a\ngaming laptop, when your job requires a heavy workload. But when your\njob requires you constantly in a meeting, only doing spreadsheets on a\nday-to-day basis, or if you are a student, sitting at lectures on end,\nthen a gaming laptop may not be for you because its battery life is\nhorrible. I mean, 3-4 hours is nice, only if you do not run any heavy\nworkload, or else it will drop to 1-1.5 hours. That's why I'm searching\nfor this *elusive* 8-hour battery laptop. I asked about it in a local\nelectronic retail store. They said it doesn't exist, only about 6 hours\nor so. Not planning to give up, I scoured the Internet to find something\nlike that.\n\n#### Low-powered solutions\n\nI came up with some solutions:\n\n\\- A laptop with a low-powered x86 CPU: like Atom (N3350, N4000, N5000,\nN4020, N5100, N6000), or m-series (m3)\n\n\\- A laptop with an ARM CPU: from MediaTek (MT8183, ...) or Qualcomm\n(7c, 7c gen 2, SQx family)\n\nAnother consideration is the operating system (OS) running on the\nlaptop. It's more important on ARM laptops because MediaTek CPUs are\nonly on ChromeOS, while Qualcomm ones are available on either ChromeOS\nor Windows. But using an ARM laptop is quite limited, especially on\nWindows, as you are constricted by the number of applications written\nfor the architecture. It's quite small. While battery life on ARM\nlaptops is vastly superior to that of x86 laptops, it doesn't matter if\nthere isn't any app for them. So, I leaned towards x86 ones. And today,\nI got a chance to try out a Chromebook.\n\nThis article is written using that same Chromebook, on Microsoft 365,\nbecause I'm more used to Office than Google Docs.\n\n#### What is Chromebook?\n\nChromebook, simply put, is a laptop with ChromeOS as the default OS.\nUnlike most OSes, it only works when connected to the Internet, even\nthough Google is trying to rectify that by allowing Android apps and\nLinux apps to be installed. The focus of the entire OS is the web\nbrowser, Chrome, which powers the OS as well. With the web browser, you\ncan, of course, browse the web. You can also install and run web apps. A\nChromebook utilizes its own cloud solution for most tasks, like office\nwith Google Docs, file storage with Google Drive (there is an internal\nstorage with a file manager). ChromeOS was built loosely on Gentoo\nLinux. I said *loosely*, because there isn't much Linux inside ChromeOS.\nMost commands are removed by Google. As the purpose of this OS is for\nweb browsing only, it's very light, and can run on some of the weakest\nhardware, say Celeron or Pentium, or cheap ARM cores. Although compared\nto Linux, not lighter by much. But much lighter than Windows by 3 GB of\nRAM.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/231011/top.png)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/231011/System_rest.png)\n\n#### My thought on Chromebook\n\nThe one I borrowed was a [HP\nChromebook](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-Chromebook-13-G1-Core-m3.215846.0.html)\nrunning [Intel Core\nm3-6y30](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/88198/intel-core-m36y30-processor-4m-cache-up-to-2-20-ghz.html)\nand 4 GB of RAM. It came out in 2016-2017 so it is quite old already. So\nmy experience will revolve around this one.\n\n\\- Keyboard lacking some keys for text editing: Home, End, Page Up /\nDown, no Function keys. Start (Super on Linux) key is gone, replaced\nwith Search key which replaces the Caps Lock for no reason. Why not just\nreplace the Start key and leave the Caps Lock alone? Those missing keys\nhave been replaced by shortcuts found by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+/** on the\nkeyboard to show off the shortcut list\n\n\\- Ran surprisingly fast on only 4GB of RAM. Could be because this\nmachine has the Android portion disabled by the organization I borrowed\nfrom\n\n\\- It's quite warm on the underside when working hard because there's no\ncooling fan (these low-powered chips don't usually have fans), but most\nof the time it's cool\n\n\\- Battery lasted about 6-7 hours, much longer than my gaming laptop. If\nrunning a heavy webpage, I think it could run for 2-3 hours\n\n\\- Lightweight. You can carry it with you like a tablet. But the same\ncan be said for Windows laptops of the same specs. But they probably run\nmuch hotter due to being a heavier OS *compared to ChromeOS*\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/231011//IMG_20230922_115538_030.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/231011/IMG_20230922_115555_363.jpg)\n\n\\- File manager is very basic. It's like they took the codebase of\nGoogle Drive and used it as basis for the file manager\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/231011/filemanager.png)\n\n\\- There's a terminal but it's hidden. You can access it using\n**Ctrl+Alt+T**, just like in Linux (which is funny, ChromeOS is loosely\nbased on Gentoo Linux). But it's quite limited in command. Type\n**help\\_advanced** to show off all commands available on ChromeOS\n\n**-** Settings: When you pull the scrollbar, the menu heading doesn't\nfollow you, which is quite useless as the function of a heading should\nbe. To be fair, Windows's Settings flaw is when you return to the\nprevious page, it doesn't *automatically scroll you to the previous\ncheckpoint*. **WHY IS IT so hard for them to design a decent Settings\napp??? They made it work ON ANDROID**\n\n**-** My Chromebook is old, so its GPU doesn't support the newest\ncodecs. Playing Youtube videos, if I leave it to run as is, the browser\ndefaults to VP9 and eats up 45% CPU. So I installed h264ify to switch\ncodec to H264 and pull the CPU usage down.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/231011/system_h264.png)\n\n\\- AUE: This is the biggest downside of using ChomeOS. There is an\nexpiry date, just like MacOS. When it hits the date, it won't receive\nany more updates from Google, even the browser, as the browser is\n**coupled with the OS. Yes, very WISE DECISION.** May have been\ndeliberate for planned obsolescence. There was news regarding\n[separating the two\napart](https://chromeunboxed.com/chromeos-116-transition-lacros-chrome-browser-seamless/),\nbut it remains to be seen what Google is planning. Does it allow to\nupdate the browser indefinitely, or just a few versions apart from the\nOS? As for my Chromebook, the update is no more, as it is expired. Still\nusable, if you don't have any concern regarding security\n\nI will be on the lookout for any Windows laptop running this CPU or\nsimilar and compare their performance and battery life."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2c:T9d3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"For the longest time, I was scared of using UEFI on my PC. With the\nexception of my laptops, which force me to use UEFI though I disabled\nSecure Boot because it's a pain to deal with, I have been using CSM mode\n(compatibility mode) that simulates BIOS. Lately with a new hard drive\nto test various Linux OSes on, I've decided to reinstall Windows 10\ninside the PC on UEFI mode, so on the new Linux hard drive I can install\nmultiple OSes without having their bootloaders stepping on each other\nlike in the BIOS age.\n\n#### Howto\n\nI learned this from [this\narticle](https://askubuntu.com/questions/509423/which-commands-to-convert-a-ubuntu-bios-install-to-efi-uefi-without-boot-repair)\nin StackExchange. These steps apply too, I guess, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch,\nor anything using GRUB as bootloader. Tldr, we *chroot* into the root\ndirectory *of the OS you want to convert*, run some commands and GRUB is\nrestored.\n\nFirst, I checked to see whether the machine is on UEFI mode using this\ncommand:\n\n*\\[ -d /sys/firmware/efi \\] \u0026\u0026 echo UEFI \\|\\| echo BIOS*\n\nProceed if it says UEFI, otherwise go into the BIOS menu and change it.\n\nAfterward, I mapped some partitions into the root directory of the OS\nthat is on the way to be converted (supposed that *sda1* is the OS\npartition, *sda2* is the EFI system partition, */mnt* is where you want\nto chroot to, could be anywhere else):\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt*\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/efi*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /dev /mnt/dev*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /proc /mnt/proc*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /sys /mnt/sys*\n\n*sudo* mount *\\--bind /run /mnt/run*\n\nLater on, I loaded a module called *efivarfs* (UEFI Runtime Variables\nSupport) using *sudo modprobe efivarfs*. Then I went in using *sudo\nchroot /mnt*.\n\nNow, depend on the OS, say Ubuntu or Fedora, you use their respective\npackage manager. For my case, that was apt. So:\n\n*apt update \u0026\u0026 apt list grub\\**\n\nCheck for package *grub-efi* and *grub-efi-amd64*\n(*grub-efi-amd64-signed* if Secure Boot was enabled, I didn't try it).\nAnd then I went:\n\n*grub-install \\--target=x86\\_64-efi \\--efi-directory=/boot/efi\n\\--bootloader-id=ubuntu \\--recheck \\--no-floppy \\--debug*\n\nAlternatively, [this\narticle](https://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi)\nsuggests reinstalling *grub-efi*. This is how I recover GRUB on Fedora,\nsince *grub-install* didn't work.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [What exactly is the problem with\nUEFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/63azo4/eli5_what_exactly_is_the_problem_with_uefi_and/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2d:T167b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"When I tried out a bunch of distros, Fedora was among the ones what\nweren't like the rest. Another was EndeavourOS, based on Arch Linux. A\nfew things I learned while using Fedora Workstation, which was using\nGNOME as its desktop environment (DE).\n\n#### Choice of desktop environment\n\nOf all the distros I tried, they all shared similar desktop\nenvironments. Some can have multiple distros, each made with a different\nDE:\n\n\\- GNOME: probably the most mature of all. It's fast, plenty of\nanimation, its design is quite professional. Except the concept is\ndifferent. It's thinking desktop in term of workspaces, so each\napplication gets their own desktop. There's no minimize button, no\nmaximize except double-clicking to do so. The Windows key (or Super key)\nbecomes a central key for most actions on the desktop. You use this to\nswitch back and forth between workspaces. GNOME takes 2^nd^ place in\nterms of memory consumption, close to KDE.\n\n\\- KDE: probably the one I liked the least. While quite polished like\nGNOME and Windows-like, it's a bit buggy, a bit too many customizations\nin Settings so quite cumbersome to use. It's also a bit laggy and heavy,\nheavier than GNOME. For Fedora cold boot, KDE desktop takes 1.5 GB RAM,\nwhile GNOME about 1.2 GB RAM. Small different but KDE is not as fast as\nGNOME.\n\n\\- Xfce: Lightweight, fast, comparable to LXQt so they both share the\nsame spot. I happen to like LXQt more due to being a Lubuntu user\ninstead of Xubuntu. The latter\n\n\\- MATE: If you enjoy the look of old GNOME from back in '09, then use\nMATE. Like Xfce and LXQt, quite light on the resource.\n\n\\- Cinnamon: Linux Mint's own implementation of GNOME, Windows-like,\nlight, fast. One of my favorite next to LXQt.\n\nNote that this is my opinion on these DEs as their original forms,\ninstead of the customized looks that can be made by other distros. See\n[Xero Linux](https://xerolinux.xyz/) for KDE or\n[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) for Xfce,\n[ZorinOS](https://zorin.com/) for GNOME, Xfce.\n\n#### Display Protocol\n\nAs of the time of writing, there exists two protocols: X11 and Wayland.\n[Wayland](https://dudemanguy.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-10-wayland-xorg/wayland-xorg.html)\nis still in development and supposed to supersede X11, which has existed\nsince [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System). I tried\nWayland out in GNOME on Fedora and here are a few things I found:\n\n\\- Firefox finally utilized Nvidia GPU for video decoding through\n[nvidia-vaapi-driver](https://github.com/elFarto/nvidia-vaapi-driver). I\ntried numerous times on Lubuntu, which uses X11, and it didn't work. I\ncan finally watch 4K content on YouTube, though Iwill probably disable\nAV1 playback on Firefox because my GPU doesn't support AV1 codec.\n\n\\- There's no fractional scaling on GNOME, AFAIK. There's only integer\nscaling (200%, \\...)\n\n\\- No custom resolution. I used that on Nvidia because they never\nsupport my resolution 1600x900, which is supported on Windows. It's only\navailable on X11.\n\n\\- Performance on [Cemu](http://cemu.info/) is noticeably slower on\nWayland than on X11. This is achieved using the Vulkan backend with GTX\n1060 and Ryzen 5 1600. It's also\n[darker](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/142s10n/is_nvida_making_cemu_darker_on_wayland/).\nThe advice on Reddit was to avoid Wayland for this application due to a\nmissing function in Vulkan.\n\n#### Package Management\n\nFedora includes GNOME software center for installing and updating apps\nas well as the OS. This is way easier, more intuitive, and has more apps\nthan using Discover, its equivalent on my Lubuntu or KDE-based distros.\n\nIf you are a hardcore and want to use the terminal then **dnf** is the\nequivalent of apt:\n\n\\- At every first run when you open the terminal, dnf caches the\nrepository's package list. It's quite annoying, slow (because I haven't\nfigured out how to change mirror but I digress). But anytime you need to\nremove a package, you don't have to *autoremove* all of its dependencies\nlike in Ubuntu, it will do it for you.\n\n#### Codec\n\nUnlike other distros, Fedora doesn't include the popular video codecs\nout-of-the-box: H264, H265 for instace. That puts a damper on the first\nimpression of anybody using Fedora. You won't be able to play any videos\nusing these codecs on the Video app (Totem) or Firefox without first\ninstalling OpenH264, and you can forget about watching H265. Lucky\nYouTube uses VP9, which is open-source so you can still watch it on\nFirefox. Installing my usual app for watching video with Nvidia Hardware\nDecoding, Celluloid, which uses\n[mpv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/xe0p52/psa_mpv_is_now_available_on_fedora_37/)\nand\n[ffmpeg](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/cant-install-codecs/73797/5)\nas backend, didn't play H264 using hardware decoding because the codec I\ninstalled didn't support it, and of course no H265. VLC, however,\nworked. It decoded H264, H265 normally. But that was because they used\ntheir own ffmpeg to do it. Using Celluloid on Flatpak, which is a\ncontainer format for storing applications, I was able to play videos\nusing hardware decoding. Celluloid on Flatpak packages its own\ndependencies, which means its own mpv and ffmpeg with support for\nhardware decoding.\n\n#### Fixing UEFI bootloader\n\nReinstall packages related to GRUB instead of running *grub-install\n--target=x86\\_64-efi* like in Ubuntu/Debian\n\n#### Microsoft Core Fonts (Arial, Times New Roman)\n\nThis one depends on preferences, but I installed these fonts so that I\ncan use the docs files exported from LibreOffice Writer on Microsoft\nWord. For Ubuntu/Debian, you can install the *ttf-mscorefonts-installer*\npackage. For Fedora, follow [this\nguide](https://mscorefonts2.sourceforge.net/) to install\n*msttcore-fonts*."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2e:T2aec,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I have just bought a couple of SSDs for cheap on Facebook. They were\ntaken from , I guess prebuilt computers that their owners want their\npreinstalled disk drives replaced. So I plan to try out a couple of\noperating systems (OS) bare metal instead of using virtual machines, so\nthat I can see how it feels.\n\n#### Windows 11\n\nThis is the first one I tried out. First off, I couldn't flash its ISO\nfile onto the USB on Linux. I guess Windows ISO are built different. So\nI used [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) from Windows to flash it. The\nprogram supports bypassing Windows 11's lousy requirements, which are\nTPM (Trusted Platform Module), Secure Boot, 4GB RAM minimum. While it's\namazing that they include those in Rufus, I didn't really need it as\nWindows 11 ISO I got was from undisclosed sources, they've already\nscrubbed off those requirements. While installing, when you get to the\nadding user screen, MAKE SURE not to connect to the Internet, if you\nwish not to login your Microsoft account and create a local account.\nAfter all installation steps, I started using Windows 11 and here is\nwhat I found:\n\n\\- Normal cold boot of Windows 11 took about 15 seconds, compared to\nWindows 10's 7 seconds. So it's slower, not a good start.\n\n\\- By default, the Start Menu is situated in the middle of the Taskbar.\nThat aggravated me, because for the last 30 years, Start Menu has always\nbeen on the left of the screen. That was the standard. And now they\ndecided to move it for poorly justified reasons.\n\n\\- Taskbar's right click menu misses a lot of the options found in\nWindows 10, especially Task Manager. Normally I hold Ctrl + Shift + Esc\nto open it, but it reminds people that it exists when they right-click\non the Taskbar.\n\n\\- Settings seems to have improved a lot after Windows 10, which has a\nlacking Settings app. However, it's still no substitution for Control\nPanel. I found myself still using it on Windows 10 and 11.\n\n\\- Right click menu is limited because menu was shorten with only few\nselections, copy, paste had turned into icons. I presumed this is for\ntouchscreen, but dang it I was on a desktop. I had to\n[hack](https://www.theverge.com/23707964/windows-11-regedit-registry-menu-how-to)\nit to restore the previous menu.\n\nIn short, I went back to Windows 10 after a day. But it's no use.\nWindows 11 will eventually become the OS I **have** to use when Windows\n10 is deprecated, much like Windows 7 before.\n\nThat was Windows 11 version 21H2. Things changed when I tried to give\nWindows 11 one more shot with 22H2. While right click menu is still\nlimited, they speed up the cold boot time to about Windows 10's time.\nTaskbar's right click menu finally got its Task Manager option back, and\nit's been redesigned to reflect the design of Windows 11. Using Windows\n11 felt a bit faster than Windows 10, especially the effects. I\ndiscovered that the Microsoft Store allows you to download apps without\nlogin into Microsoft account and I found Windows Subsystem for Linux and\nAndroid. The Android one was amazing. While YouTube didn't work, I was\nable to install\n[SmartTubeNext](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext) and played\nsome videos on it, fully hardware-accelerated. This is different than\nany emulator I have tried, which never had hardware acceleration. The\nLinux one is fine. I just don't see the appeal, beside using this when\ninstalling bare-metal or using VirtualBox is not an option. Keep in mind\nthat each subsystem **eats up about 2 GB of RAM**, so be mindful when\nusing them on anything less than **8 GB of RAM**.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/win11-taskmgr.png)\n\n#### Linux Mint\n\nI recently turned to Linux as a daily driver, after multiple incidents\nof Windows 10 on my laptop threatening me that it would update itself to\nWindows 11, and the button to skip it was a rather small one on the left\nof the screen, and you will definitely miss it, **as** Microsoft\ndesigned it so. I explored a couple of options in the Ubuntu ecosystem\nbefore settling for Lubuntu:\n\n\\- Ubuntu was a bit heavy, I wanted something leaner. Besides, when I\ntried to install it, I am stucked at partitioning. For whatever choice I\npicked, it wouldn't let me continue.\n\n\\- Xubuntu, though as light as Lubuntu with its Xfce desktop environment\ninstead of LxQt, is rather metallic in color and quite bright.\n\nUsing Lubuntu for a while, I decided to look into Linux Mint. Based on\nUbuntu, but without **Snap**, which is already a plus, it's regarded\nhighly within the Linux community for its simplicity, ease of use. Linux\nMint has a few flavors to choose:\n\n\\- Cinnamon, the team's own take on GNOME\n\n\\- MATE (read ma-te), continuation of GNOME 2\n\n\\- Xfce\n\nI chose Cinnamon, as that's the default of the OS. Here are my thought:\n\n\\- The design of the desktop is quite nice, due to it looking like\nWindows 10 but better.\n\n\\- Their Settings app works more like the Control Panel, where it's just\na collection of tools. It takes a bit getting used to, cause I'm used to\nLubuntu.\n\n\\- Most of the apps you use are available from the start, like Firefox,\noffice with LibreOffice, watch movies with Celluloid (mpv with\ninterface). However, if you wish to install more, there's a software\nmanager that you can run to install more. It works like an app store for\nyour PC.\n\n\\- Unlike Windows 10 and 11, I can choose whether to let it auto update\nor not, and update what packages. There's an app that takes care of\nthat, if not I can use **apt**.\n\nWith Ubuntu 24.04 slowly turning to force Snap as its app management to\nall users, kinda like Windows, people including me are considering\nmoving shops to Linux Mint because at least they have yet to sell like\ncorporate sellout.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/cinnamon.png)\n\n#### Elementary OS\n\nThis is another OS that is based on Ubuntu. Seems to be a running theme\nfor my choice of Oses. I guess because Ubuntu itself is popular and\nbeginner-friendly. Whenever Linux is mentioned to anybody, their first\nthoughts are Ubuntu and Debian. I began my journey to download the ISO\nfile.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/elementary.jpg)\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye is that they asked you to pay for the\nOS. I was planning to skip this OS when I tried typing zero into the\nprice and it allowed me to download again. Usually in other OSes, they\nask you before you download if you'd like to donate them some money.\nThis one essentially tricked you into thinking that you have to buy it.\nWell, maybe there's a reason for that. I installed the OS and ran it. It\nlooked very good. There have been works done to make Elementary OS look\nlike a beautiful piece of art. Quite like macOS except I liked this way\nmore. That is Pantheon desktop environment, by the way. Like Linux Mint,\nthey use software manager called AppCenter to manage all packages. But I\nhad to give this OS a pass. Because when I tried installing NVIDIA\ndriver on and restarted my PC, the desktop environment stopped showing,\nleaving the terminal behind. So there were some bugs or compatibility\nproblems with Pantheon. Maybe if I had an AMD GPU or using Intel CPU, I\ncould use it a bit longer. Shame!\n\n#### Pop OS\n\nWell, another derivative of Ubuntu developed by System76, a manufacture\nof desktops and laptops specifically for Linux. So unlike other Linux\ndistributions (or distros), this OS is not community-driven but\nmaintained by a company, so there is a degree of responsibility to\nensure their OS work perfectly on their products, and by association our\nown PCs. They use their own desktop environment, which is COSMIC, a\ncustomized GNOME. Well, not really heavily customized. I could point out\na few similarities between them. Downloading ISO was simple enough.\nThere was even a specialized version for Nvidia GPU, like in my desktop.\nStill, I tried the normal version and worked the way up. Unlike that\nbuggy Elementary OS, it actually ran after installing the GPU driver.\nThe distro was quite good even if I didn't spend as much time on it. I\nguess the experience is the same if you've used any other distros with\nGNOME desktop.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/Pop-OS-22.04-Desktop-beta.webp)\n\n#### Debian\n\nThe daddy of all distros based on it. This distro is recommended only\nfor server because of its stability, reliability. Part of it is because\nthe packages on this one are old, not as up-to-date in order to be\nstable. Unlike on my server which is running Debian 12 (bookworm), I've\ndecided to try the testing branch. And guess what, it was a bad idea.\nThe kernel update version 6.4 from the testing branch broke the OS. I\nhad to boot from an older one (5.10) to salvage it. I pulled the kernel\n6.1 from Debian 12 to run on my desktop and it worked. I installed KDE\nPlasma desktop environment, ran it in Wayland mode. (Wayland here is a\nwindow system protocol, like its predecessor, X11. Its job is to render\nwindows and any elements onscreen). And it **ran** like a turtle, CPU\nspiked to 400% on a Ryzen 5 1600 6-core. It wasn't until I installed the\nNvidia GPU driver that it got better. However, I didn't really like\nKDE's look. It's a bit rugged, square, even though I could say the same\nthing about Lubuntu's LXQt. But I did not like it. I know about GNOME\nand KDE are vastly customizable, and I would get to those one day, for\nnow it's just my first impression on the desktop environment. I later\ntried KDE on Fedora and also didn't like it, either. If you're\nacquainted with using Ubuntu, then Debian shouldn't be any different,\nsince Ubuntu derived from Debian.\n\n#### Fedora\n\nThere are so many things to say about this one that it deserves its own\narticle.\n\n#### EndeavourOS\n\nThis one is based on Arch Linux. Despite what everyone said about how\nhard it is to use it, there's even a meme \"I use Arch, btw\" meaning it's\na tough cookie to crack, I had fun with it. It's easy to use, its\npackage repository is packed with applications that have newest\nversions. Firefox is in it instead of in a container format like Snap on\nUbuntu or exists only as *firefox-esr* like Debian. It's not insane in\navoiding proprietary components at all cost like Fedora, to the\ndetriment of the usability of the OS. And it's a new kid in town, not\nsurrounded with dramas like\n[*Manjaro*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlD17OjFAc). It's only\ncrime is that its package manager,\n*p[acman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Rosetta)*, works a\nlittle different than the rest.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/Screenshot_endeavourOS.png)\n\n#### Zorin OS\n\nMuch like Linux Mint, it is based on Ubuntu and looks like Windows. It\ncomes with 2 flavors: Core in GNOME, Lite in Xfce.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/Zorin-OS-16.1-Core.png)\n#### Xero Linux\n\nBased on Arch Linux like EndeavourOS before it and also a new kid in\ntown. But while by default EndeavourOS uses Xfce, this one uses KDE\nPlasma as its beautifully crafted desktop environment, with a GNOME\ndashboard and a wobbly effect whenever I move the window.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230823-1/xerolinux.webp)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2f:Tc54,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After multiple times compiling drivers on multiple environments,\nspecifically OpenWrt, I'd decided to see if I could compile the driver\nof my wifi adapter, [rtl8821cu](https://github.com/brektrou/rtl8821CU), for my\nRaspberry Pi 3 from my laptop. Raspberry Pi ran on DietPi, which is\nbased on Debian.\n\n#### Compile on Raspberry Pi\n\nFirst, I installed *raspberrypi-kernel-header*, which is a package\ncontaining the kernel source of Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, I ran this\ncommand to compile the driver, it worked:\n\n*make -j4*\n\nI tried out this trick I learned from r8152 source compiling, but it\nfailed:\n\n*make -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd) -j\\$(nproc)*\n\nIt didn't work when I added cross compiling parameters, either:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE= -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd)\n-j\\$(nproc)*\n\n#### Compile on x86\n\nI downloaded the [Raspberry Pi Kernel Source\nCode](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux) from Github and\ninstalled the package gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu. I used the following line\nbut that didn't work:\n\n*make -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd) -j\\$(nproc)*\n\nSo is the next one:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE= -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd)\n-j\\$(nproc)*\n\nAfter reading *Makefile* in the *rtl8821cu* folder and found a line at\nthe *modules* part:\n\n*\\$(MAKE) ARCH=\\$(ARCH) CROSS\\_COMPILE=\\$(CROSS\\_COMPILE) -C \\$(KSRC)\nM=\\$(shell pwd) modules*\n\nI rechecked my command line. While **ARCH, CROSS\\_COMPILE** I filled in\ncorrectly, I should be filling in **KSRC=\\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e** instead of\n**-C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e**.

So I did:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- oldconfig \u0026\u0026 make\nARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- prepare*\n\nIt asked a ton of questions though.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230722/make%20oldconfig.jpg)\n\nAbout to finish, it came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230722/make2.jpg)\n\nI looked into line 2501 of Makefile of the driver, it was the *module*\npart, so not the place yet. Line 1929 of Makefile of the kernel source\nshowed more promise.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230722/make3.jpg)\n\nI looked into *Makefile.modfinal*. It's like the file and the error are\nboth looking for *module.lds* but it's not available in the kernel\nsource. Temporarily, I copied *module.lds.S* to *module.lds.* It did\ncompile, but it didn't work on Raspberry Pi, likely because of kernel\n6.1.21 currently on Pi, compared to kernel source 6.1.35.\n\n#### What happened if you missed ARCH and CROSS\\_COMPILE?\n\nMissing **ARCH** came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230722/missing%20arch.jpg)\n\nMissing **CROSS\\_COMPILE** came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230722/missing%20cross%20compile.jpg)\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo I guess for now I just compile the driver against the source on the\ndevice then.

I live in\nLubuntu town. That's a funny way to say that I use Lubuntu as my daily\ndriver on my laptop. On my laptop, which is an Intel i7 9750H + GTX 1060\ncombo, it's been kind to me and given me my preferred screen resolution,\nwhich was 1600x900 out of the box. That wasn't the case for my desktop,\nwhich is an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 + GTX 1060 combo, as it gave me its default\nresolution of 1920x1080. There's nothing wrong with it, other than the\nletters appear like tiny dots on screen. When I opened the Monitor\nSettings, it didn't give me 1600x900, instead there were 1920x0180,\n1680x1050, 1600x1200. Nvidia Settings certainly didn't help, it didn't\nhave 1600x900, either. So I had my work cut out for me.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230721/nvidia.jpg)\n\n#### Finding answers in vain\n\nI first tried out [this\nmethod](https://itslinuxfoss.com/set-custom-resolution-using-xrandr/)\nto set a custom resolution. However, it returned this error and wouldn't\nallow me to add that resolution:\n\n*X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)*\n\n*Major opcode of failed request: 140 (RANDR)*\n\n*Minor opcode of failed request: 18 (RRAddOutputMode)*\n\nI searched everywhere for a solution to no avail. That means, while\nthere are answers, none satisfies what I'm looking for.. So I tried the\nnext method, setting it on Nvidia's side using Nvidia Settings.\nAccording to [this\npost](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=255287),\n*you want to do this by setting your ViewPortIn to your desired\nresolution, and your Panning to the desired resolution as well. Do NOT\ntouch ViewPortOut*.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230721/lxqt-config-monitor.jpg)\n\nI applied it and saved the settings to X File. However it won't write\nthe X File **xorg.conf** down to */etc/X11/* so I have to issue a\ncommand [*sudo chmod u+x\n/usr/share/screen-resolution-extra/nvidia-polkit*](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/cant-save-to-x-configuration-file-on-nvidia-settings/185069)\nto make it work. After I'd done that, I logged out and back in.\nInterestingly, the login screen showed that the custom resolution\nworked, but as soon as I logged in*,* the screen *turned back to\n1920x1080* and Nvidia reported my screen resolution as Auto.\n\n#### Stumbled upon the solution\n\nAt that point, I was stump. Like what do I do now? I kept trying back\nand forth between two ways for hours. Nothing works. Until something\namazing happened. I read somewhere that after saving the settings on the\nNvidia's side, I should change the monitor settings from the OS side, so\nI switched it to 1680x1050, logged out, logged back in. And voila. It\nfinally clicked. I can't believe it. So I guess that's how it's done.\n\nAccording to the [official\nguide](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/persist-nvidia-x-server-settings/158102/5),\nthe desktop environment, in this case LXQt, may have overridden any\nconfiguration from nvidia-settings, hence why Lubuntu switched to\n1920x1080 after its login screen was 1600x900. The way I pulled it off\nseems like a hack, because it is. I'm supposed to either change\nresolution from the monitor settings within Lubuntu or disable any\nfeature for managing displays. But hey, as long as it works.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230721/it_work.png)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"31:T1620,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"If you have to do research on cell phones like I do, you'll eventually\nfind that any phone can have multiple models existing in the wild. For\neach market, say Asia, Japan, the US, China\\... they released a\ndifferent model. Most of the times, it supported different **frequency\nbands**, because some country like the US, Korea,\\... have **cell phone\nstandard** that separated them from the rest of the world. Other times,\nit was a model exclusive to a network, a company, an event. Today, I\nwanted to tell a couple of stories involving phone models catering to\ndifferent frequency bands.\n\n#### Oneplus One: Holy grail of phone design, price-performance ratio, practically useless as a phone\n\nThis was back in 2014. I just finished my university entrance test and\ngot into a major university in my city. So I was given fairly big budget\nto purchase my favorite thing. I chose to buy a smartphone. I was the\nfirst of my family to get a smartphone. However, this was for my\n*second* one. The first one I bought beforehand was a [Nokia\nLumia 820](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_lumia_820-4968.php). It was a\nWindows Phone, because my friend convinced me to the platform. It was\nnice and fast, but also lacking in applications. The phone in question,\nOneplus One, was pushed heavily in online marketing. There was an event\nback then which you typed in your email on their website and prayed to\nthe lucky star to get an *invite* to buy their phone\ninternationally. SO of course I didn't win.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230707/OnePlus-Never-Settle.jpg)\n\nI later found a model that was selling at a nearby store. Costed about\nthe same as the one on their website, which was \\$350. To put it into\nperspective, a phone with a similar performance to Oneplus One was\ndouble the price. So you can see the value Oneplus offered. Anyway, I\nbought the phone. I inserted my SIM card in, not connected. I tried\nmultiple times, including restarting the phone, switch on and off\n*Airplane Mode*, change *Select Network* to *Manual*. I found out later\nthat **maybe** the model I bought was a Chinese one, not an\ninternational one, so the frequency bands might be different. Figured,\nsince there was only a limited number of the latter in the world due to\nthat event. I searched for ways to fix this. ROM hacks, firmware\nupdates, modem fix, \\... many ways. I tried them all. This was during\nthe era when custom ROMs, which were customized Android OSes, reigned\nsupreme, and was a way to boost a phone's performance because of early\n2010s' lackluster specs on smartphones. Nowadays, it's becoming harder\nsince phones have become cheaper, more capable, and more secure. Forums\nlike [XDA-Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/) were where I\nfrequented to find ways to fix the phone. At one point, I even stuck a\npaperclip in to try to fix the SIM card slot. Hilariously, the phone\nstore couldn't fix it. So I had to fix it by slowly pulling it out. I\nsuccessfully pulled it, but the phone still didn't work on my network.\nSo I was stuck with a Lumia and a 5.5-inch tablet. But at least it had a\nSnapdragon 801, a beast of an ARM CPU at the time. At least until I\nlater changed to Coolpad Note 3 Lite after I broke my Lumia 820. FYI,\nthe Coolpad phone was horrible and slow.\n\nSometime later, I pulled the Oneplus One out for my sister after\nretiring it long ago, gave it an update to Android 6 and **then** it can\naccept my SIM card, albeit only 3G was possible.\n\n**Oneplus Nord CE 2 Lite: How not paying attention to About Phone can\ncost you big time**\n\nJust last June, 2023. I planned to buy this phone in anticipation for my\ntravel to the US. I needed a phone that could use the US cellular\nnetwork without buying from the US, because I thought it would be\nexpensive. I checked the specs of the phone online, cross-compare to\nother phones of the brand. I was looking for headphone jack and\ndual-SIM, because I hate this trend of removing what should already be\npossible on thin phones. I checked out 8 Pro, 7 Pro, Nord N20 and found\nthis one fit, and somebody resold this used one for about 3.2 million\nVND. So I took the chance and bought it. After a few hours, I innocently\nsearched for the model, CPH2381, seems that there were 2 models of this\nphone. And I was hit with results from Amazon India and Indian phone\nstores. While the other model, CPH2409, was the international one.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230707/cph2381.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230707/cph2409.jpg)\n\nThen something clicked. On the page they advertised this used phone,\nthere was an image of the phone's About Phone page that said *model\nCPH2381*. So because of **one little mistake***,* I took home a phone\nthat will most likely be useless in the US, because it didn't support\nenough frequency bands from the US. And I can't take the phone back,\nbecause technically it still works here in Vietnam. So no dice. I ended\nup once again, gave this one to my sister so she could replace her aging\nSamsung Galaxy A7. There goes my birthday present.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230707/OnePlus-Nord-CE-2-Lite-5G_FoneArena-11-1024x691.jpg)\n\n#### What we can take away for these stories\n\n\\- Probably pay more attention to the model if you are looking for a\nspecific phone, since it's so rare and hard to find.\n\n\\- Just to go the country you plan to go and buy the phone from there.\nBecause now I have to pay double for a phone in the US, half for the\nOneplus CE 2 Lite, half for whatever I will buy in the US to use.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Oneplus One\nSpecifications](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one-6327.php)\n\n\\- [OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G\nSpecifications](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_ce_2_lite_5g-11344.php)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"32:T2899,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I wrote a post on compiling OpenWrt from source a few months ago. Since\nthen, I've been playing around with its source, building new images with\nit to test on virtual machines. OpenWrt finally added [support for\nOrange Pi R1 Plus (LTS)](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/12818) for\ntheir next release, 23.05. And with a new driver for RTL8153, a chipset\nused in the board, I decided to go back to patching OpenWrt one more\ntime.\n\n#### Kernel patch\n\nAs shown from my previous post on OpenWrt for Orange Pi R1 Plus, kernel\npatches are how they affect the kernel to their preferences for running\nOpenWrt, like allowing unsupported devices to run the OS. The Linux\nkernel source has upstreamed dts for R1 Plus on v6.3 and LTS on v6.4,\nand now is *backported* to kernel 5.15 for OpenWrt 23.05 using kernel\npatches. Patches are created using either *diff* or *git diff*.\n\n#### How to create diff\n\nIt's actually quite easy. Just follow this command:\n\n*diff -rupN \\\u003csource\\\u003e \\\u003ctarget\\\u003e \\\u003e \\\u003coutput\\\u003e*\n\nWith:\n\n\\- r to compare with subdirectories, subfolders\n\n\\- u outputs NUM (default 3) lines of unified context (yeah I don't get\nit)\n\n\\- p shows which C function each change is in\n\n\\- N treats absent files as empty\n\nOr:\n\n*git diff \\\u003csource\\\u003e \\\u003ctarget\\\u003e \\\u003e \\\u003coutput\\\u003e*\n\n#### Patch new driver into the kernel\n\nI first tried using */dev/null* as source to diff against *r8152.c* file\nfrom Realtek, and then put it in as patch. I deleted a patch related to\n*r8152.c* so it remained original to kernel source. I put the patch in\n*target/linux/generic/hack-5.15*, same as where I deleted the previous\npatch. But replacing the kernel driver wasn't easy, I tried\n\n*\\-\\-- a/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*\n\n*+++ /dev/null*\n\n*\\-\\-- /dev/null*\n\n*+++ b/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*\n\nor\n\n*\\-\\-- /dev/null*\n\n*+++ b/drivers/net/usb/r8152.c*\n\nThe source didn't compile due to the file already existing in the\nkernel.\n\nSo I did the hard way. I went into *dl* folder, extract *r8152.c* from\n*linux-5.15.117.tar.xz* (at the time OpenWrt was built on kernel\n5.15.117) then diff against the same file from Realtek. It compiled\nsuccessfully. I could run it well on a virtual machine.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230623/patch_2.jpg)\n\nApparently, the compiler doesn't read anything above the first change in\nthe patch. So the lines before that is considered comments to the\ncompiler. I added a note to say that this driver is not from the kernel\nsource.\n\n#### Patch new driver into ImmortalWrt\n\nI also used ImmortalWrt 21.02 for testing their software offloading\n*TurboACC*. Originally, ImmortalWrt wouldn't compile with the original\nsource because of lack of 'libcap'. I found out that the library existed\nin 22.03 of OpenWrt, not in 21.02 which was the base for ImmortalWrt. So\nI copied it from OpenWrt at *package/libs/libcap* and took it to\nImmortalWrt.

Unfortunately, my [network\ndriver](https://www.realtek.com/en/component/zoo/category/network-interface-controllers-10-100-1000m-gigabit-ethernet-usb-3-0-software)\nwon't compile under Linux kernel version 6.1. I thought they were just\nkidding when they said kernel version \\\u003c= 5.17. So I held off upgrading\nmy server to Debian 12. A short while back, I read this\n[post](https://jamesachambers.com/orange-pi-i96-getting-started-guide/)\nabout getting i96 board from Orange Pi to work. That got me thinking.\n[Are kernel and OS\nseparated?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/913351/why-are-the-operating-system-and-kernel-treated-separately-in-linux)\nThe board in question could run Debian 11 Bullseye on kernel 3.10, which\nwas very old.\n\n#### Debian 10\n\nBecause I couldn't find the ISO for Debian 11 that is currently on my\nserver to replicate the server environment on a VM, I used Debian 10\nISO. Lucky enough! It came with kernel 4.19. While installing, I tried\nusing a mirror server from Vietnam to speed up downloading packages. It\nworked! So good that I changed mirrors on my server, my laptop OS to\nVietnam to. As previously, I downloaded packages from the sources, which\nare from the US so they were slow.\n\nI upgraded [Debian 10 to\n11](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/update-upgrade-debian-10-to-debian-11-bullseye/)\nby changing all instances of *buster* in */etc/apt/source.list* to\n*bullseye* and use *apt full-upgrade*. Debian 11 gave me kernel 5.10,\nsame as my server. I added the\n[*backport*](https://wiki.debian.org/Backports) repository to the apt\nsource list, because they have new softwares and kernels there:\n\n*deb http://debian.xtdv.net/debian/ bullseye-backports main*\n\nNext, I searched for a new kernel by filtering apt list:\n\n*apt list linux-image\\* \\| less*\n\nIt came up with tons of results so it could get confusing. Fortunately,\nthe kernel the OS used probably looks like *linux-image-5.10.0-23-amd64*\nso using this, I could track down the kernel I need, like\n*linux-image-6.1.0-0.deb11.7-amd64*. I did try one with *cloud* in it,\nand it shrunk the font on screen. After installing, it would generate a\nnew config file for the boot loader, GRUB. The next restart, it will\n*reboot to the new kernel*. And it did. Here was the result\nof *uname -a*:\n\n*Linux debian 6.1.0-0.deb11.7-amd64 \\#1 SMP PREEMPT\\_DYNAMIC Debian\n6.1.20-2\\~bpo11+1 (2023-04-23) x86\\_64 GNU/Linux*\n\n* *\n\nI also tried upgrading to Debian 12 while *holding* the\n*linux-image-amd64* from upgrading, to see if it was possible to get to\nDebian 12 without using kernel 6.1. It also worked.\n\n#### Lubuntu 22.04\n\nI replicated the experiment on a fresh Lubuntu 22.04.2 VM. It was a bit\ndifferent. The package I was looking for was\n*linux-image-5.15.0-73-generic*. The newest kernel they got was\n*linux-image-5.19.0-43-generic* so I tried *linux-image-6.1.0-1013-oem*.\nIt booted back in after installing and restarting the VM.\n\n#### Compiling driver\n\nBack to Debian 11 with kernel 6.1, I tried compiling driver again after\ninstalling *linux-headers-6.1.0-0.deb11.7-amd64*.

I downloaded it and compiled against kernel\nversion 6.1 and installed it. It worked, without any errors from the old\nversion. There was also a driver already in the kernel so I tested both\ndrivers. The in-tree kernel module required firmwares to be installed,\nyou can find it in *firmware-realtek* package in *bullseye-backports*\nrepository. However, Debian didn\\'t recognize the network USB, so I have\nto force driver by hand using this command as root (not sudo, it didn\\'t\nwork):\n\n*echo 0bda 8156 \\\u003e /sys/bus/usb/drivers/r8152/new\\_id*\n\nThen it recognized the USB. By using **iperf3**, I measured performance\nbetween 2 drivers. While they were able to saturate the 1Gbps bandwidth,\nthe in-tree module took 10% more CPU usage compared to the Realtek\ndriver. The in-tree module also required a hacky workaround for the\nserver to recognize, so I opted for the Realtek one."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"34:Tbbc,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After writing blogs for over a month, I checked to see if my blog showed\nup on Google Search.

I thought that was\nsome kind of April Fool joke so I ignored it. Today, I received a\ncommunity post by Youtuber [Cynical\nReviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DCPS2j-o0bvfIilkc8RSw/community?lb=UgkxRDC4JuhK_O3jyMqIIyGe8a0u850H6qTR)\nsaying the same thing yesterday. So I thought: \"We're in the endgame\nnow\".\n\n![](ic/images/blog/Tech/23/230511/ban_adblock.png)\n\n#### My history of the Internet\n\nI've been with the Internet since the very beginning of it. I used\ndial-up back in the 2000s and switched to DSL later on. My family used\nto chat on Yahoo Messenger, play flash games (RIP Adobe Flash, you will\nbe missed for your large catalog of content you provided for us), play\nBoom Online, and watch videos on Youtube. Those days, Internet was\nexpensive, counted by MBs you consumed, so you had to watch the amount.\nI only downloaded heavy files at night to cut cost. But it was less\nrestrictive, less corporate, curated like today. It was the \"wild west\"\nwhere anything could happen. You could find fun things while searching\nthe old web. Back at that time, it was Yahoo Search, nobody heard of\nGoogle yet. Youtube was its own company then, just launched. I started\nwatching it at a later time. I used to watch Inuyasha, the entire\ncollection on Youtube, because copyright wasn't enforced then. I started\nwatching [nigahiga](https://www.youtube.com/@ryanhiga) in 2021. If you\nfollow his channel, you can basically see the history of Youtube and the\nworld of the second decade of the 21^st^ century unfolds.\n\n#### What's wrong with today's Youtube?\n\nIt's generally what's wrong when anything becomes too big, too popular.\nIt's becoming sanitized, safe, family-friendly (whatever that means),\ncorporate. And Youtube is no exception. I see its changes from a service\ncentered around its creator to slowly moving away, instead pleasing the\nadvertizers, the investors, the big names in the MSM (mainstream media).\nSo Google created various changes to their platform, including but not\nlimited to: demonetize any video with curse words in it (even videos not\nmeant for kids); false copyright claims run rampant (even on channels\nwhose videos are owned by the creator get copyrighted); losing revenue\nby Youtube taking your copyrighted video and giving it to the \"original\"\nowner; ad runtime increase; before video then after video then middle,\nfrom 3, 5 seconds, to 15 seconds, skippable to nowadays unskippable,\nsome ads even 15 minutes, a lot of them are scam;\n[Adpocalypse](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/YouTube_Adpocalypse);\nand now, about to force me to turn off ad-blocker.\n\n#### Commentary\n\nLike hell I'm turning off ad-blocker. This has been going on at other\nsites as well. They detect that you're using ad-blocker, block the site\nand \"ask\" you to take it down. Sure, take it down so they can shove ads\ncovering your screen, loud videos in your face. While I can ignore any\nother sites doing this, I can't ignore Youtube. It has become a large\npart of everyone's lives and livelihoods. I can just buy Premium and\nforget about all this, but that's on top of more bills to pay (Netflix,\nInternet, VieOn), and you pay for something that is and will always be\nfree. Maybe you can buy it to support your creators, but that's the\ncase, why do they have to take sponsorships and Patreons, open their own\nmerchandise store then? Sponsorships are ads that are on top of\nYoutube's dumb ads, this time INSIDE the videos. As seen in adguard's\n[article](https://adguard.com/en/blog/firefox-manifestv3-chrome-adblocking.html)\nand EFF's\n[article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening),\nthis isn't the first time Google tried to shut down ad-block. And to me,\nit's kind of depressing thinking about what's to come, as the Internet\nbecomes more restrictive as time goes on. Soon due to geopolitics, there\nwill be a localNet^(tm)^ instead of Internet, where each country has\ntheir own version of the Internet. And because your typical user doesn't\ncare, they will stay on Chrome and Youtube, which Google has the power\nover and can tell us what to see and not see, not just ads, but contents\nthat fit their \"vision\". Firefox may give us some freedom from Chrome\nnow, but for how long? I saw even Mozilla has lost its\n[focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/)\n[over](https://mozilla.social/explore) the years. I thought DuckDuckGo\nfocuses on privacy, but then [they sell your data to\nMicrosoft](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-browser-allows-microsoft-trackers-due-to-search-agreement/).\nMy favored Linux distribution, Ubuntu, becomes more corporate, forcing\nweird decisions like [this](https://evertpot.com/firefox-ubuntu-snap/)\nand\n[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/j3ajnf/whats_wrong_with_snaps_why_so_many_people_hate_it/).\nReading\n[on](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/wxra6o/we_already_live_in_a_cyberpunk/)\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/b5srqp/do_we_live_in_cyberpunk_already/),\nand recently finished watching [Cyberpunk\nEdgerunner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtqIas3bYhg), I think we are\nalready living in a cyberpunk dystopia. Various service we use for our\nconveniences like Facebook, Google might as well came out of George\nOrwell's *1984*, or I can do one better, Aldous Huxley's [*Brave New\nWorld*](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/yq7yt/so_i_read_brave_new_world_how_is_it_a_dystopia/).\nMaybe\\... This is the endgame for all of us."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"37:T1f4c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I recently got my hand on a new router to play with. It's an [Orange Pi\nR1 Plus\nLTS](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/orange-pi-R1-Plus-LTS.html),\nan Rockchip RK3328 board with dual-gigabit Ethernet ports. The reason\nfor the *LTS* or *Long Term Support* is because of chip shortage, they\nlacked the Realtek RTL8211 chip for the WAN port, so they substituted it\nwith Motorcomm YT8531C because it was more abundant. I plan to use this\nboard as either a DNS Server to speed up domain querying in place of my\nRaspberry Pi, or as a router. There is a similar board which this one\ntakes inspiration from (including device tree source, more on that\nlater), [NanoPi\nR2S](https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product\u0026product_id=282).\nHowever, that board was pricier and I felt a bit adventurous that day.\nSo first off, I tried out Openwrt on this board, since it was\nrecommended by the board manufacturer.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230523/my_r1.jpg)\n\n#### Different flavors of OpenWrt\n\nWhen I bought this board used, they gave me a metal case, a 32GB SD card\nwith their own version of OpenWrt 21.02 installed. It was packed to the\nbrim with stuff, Docker, adblock, bandwidth monitor, wake on LAN,\ntorrent downloader, DLNA, Dynamic DNS. It wasn't for my liking since it\nslowed the OS down so I tried something else.\n\nFollowing [this\npage](https://orangepi.vn/huong-dan-tai-cac-ban-openwrt-cho-orange-pi-r1-plus-lts.html),\nI tried out the manufacturer's OpenWrt. Much like the previous one, it\nwas based on 21.02 but fairly minimal. A Youtube named Van Tech Corner\n[created his own OpenWrt\nrelease](https://github.com/vantechcorner/openwrt-orangepi) from the\n[source code provided by the\nmanufacturer](https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/openwrt). You can\ncheck out the [unboxing and\ntesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtdBMK8Cyx0\u0026pp=ygUMb3JhbmdlIHBpIHIx)\nvideo,\n[similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7dTmngyaVM\u0026pp=ygUKbmFub3BpIHIycw%3D%3D)\nvideo for NanoPi R2S. The two releases differ in the number of packages\npreinstalled. I tested the Van Tech's one. It was better because of its\nslim size. But when I tried to install any package that has a kernel\ndependency, like Wireguard, 4G USB support (RNDIS), it said *The\ninstalled version of package kernel is not compatible.* According to the\nOpenWrt [page](https://openwrt.org/faq/cannot_satisfy_dependencies),\nthese were self-compiled image, and couldn't use kernel-related packages\nfrom the official repository, but had to be either included in or built\nbeforehand and installed externally. I tried out OpenWrt official\ndownload [page](https://downloads.openwrt.org/), but no luck for this\nboard. NanoPi R2S did have an image, though. So I'm out of luck until\nofficial support from OpenWrt or Orange Pi, right?\n\n#### A daring approach: Compile from source\n\nBefore this, I compiled Asterisk for my VOIP server experiment. It was\nthe recommended way of installing it, as the one on the Ubuntu repo\n(repository) is old. I just followed the instructions and it compiled\nand installed. Another instance is driver install. Some drivers like my\nRTL8156 2.5Gbps Ethernet USB for my server had to be compiled from\nsource because again, Debian's one was too old to support it. So I\nchecked out source code from [Van\nTech](https://github.com/vantechcorner/openwrt-orangepi),\nwhich is a derivative (or fork) of the source code from Orange Pi's\nOpenWrt. At first, I just randomly followed instruction, feeds update,\nfeeds install. Inside menuconfig, Global build settings, I picked\n*Select all target specific packages by default*, *Select all kernel\nmodule packages by default*. So it took *a few hours* to either compiled\nand didn't run on the R1 Plus board, or it caught an error halfway.\nAfter a few more tries, I eventually got it compiling correctly, though\nI chose to *make -j1* because I needed to trace the error if it popped\nup.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230523/menuconfig.jpg)\n\nAfter testing the compiled image on the board to verify it running\ncorrectly, I searched Google and found [this forum post from OpenWrt and\nimage and source code from\nwalmartshopper](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/orange-pi-r1-plus-support/84824/246).\nIt was newer, version 22.03, and it worked using their provided image.\n\nI got curious about the changes in the source code that Orange Pi made,\nso I used Visual Studio Code to look into the source. I searched for\nanything related to Orange Pi R1 Plus (LTS included) and came across\nmultiple results. I will tell you some notable ones:\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230523/kernel_patch.jpg)\n\n\\- The .patch files inside *target/linux/rockchip/patches-5.4* and\n*package/boot/uboot-rockchip/patches*. According to\n[kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/process/applying-patches.html),\nthese are kernel patches. This is how Orange Pi add support for their R1\nPlus (and LTS) board to OpenWrt, even though you can't find this board\non OpenWrt's download page. They patched dts files in the kernel, in\naddition to the YT8531C driver for the ethernet.\n\n\\- *target/linux/rockchip/image/armv8.mk* shows how OpenWrt build the\nimage for the board, as well as *package/boot/uboot-rockchip/Makefile*\nfor the bootloader.\n\nNote that this is an ARM processor, so the boot process is different\nthan your computer. It requires a dtb, or a device tree blob that is\ncompiled from dts - device tree source file, and its own bootloader.\nThey usually use U-Boot. To this day, Orange Pi R1 Plus (and LTS) dts\nfiles haven't been upstreamed, or merged back to the OpenWrt source. The\nLinux kernel source has upstreamed dts for R1 Plus on v6.3 and LTS on\nv6.4. Maybe in the future, as there has been several attempts at doing\nso at OpenWrt pull requests.\n\nLooking at other git repos like from\n[walmartshopper](https://github.com/walmartshopper/openwrt-orangepi-r1-plus/commits/openwrt-22.03?author=walmartshopper),\n[baiyut](https://github.com/baiywt/openwrt/commits/openwrt-22.03?author=baiywt)\n(who is in charge of the patches in Orange Pi OpenWrt, his own repo also\nhas OpenWrt 22.03),\n[ImmortalWrt](https://github.com/immortalwrt/immortalwrt) (which allows\nnon-upstreamable patches), they also applied this technique to support\nthe R1 Plus (and LTS). From [walmartshopper's\nrepo](https://github.com/walmartshopper/openwrt-orangepi-r1-plus/commits/openwrt-22.03?author=walmartshopper),\nI tried merging OpenWrt 22.03 current branch to his, but the number of\nconflicts is too big, I wondered if the amount of work put into keeping\nR1 Plus up-to-date with OpenWrt was this huge. It's quite amazing.\n\nIn the future, with the release of OpenWrt 23.05, if those customized\nrepos don't support the board, and OpenWrt doesn't support either, I\nwill see if it's possible to port the files for R1 Plus (and LTS) over.\n\n#### Note on using Android TV Box as router\n\nBefore all this, I tried testing a X96 Air S905X3 4GB and Mecool M8S Pro\nW S905W 2GB with this OpenWrt implementation by\n[ophub](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt). He used Armbian\nbootloader to boot to OpenWrt environment. One of the flaws I discovered\nafter testing [Coreelec](https://coreelec.org/) on the Mecool is that [I\ncan\\'t boot back to Armbian or OpenWrt\nanymore](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/18871-boot-from-usb-having-armbian-on-emmc/),\ndue to Coreelec overwriting the eMMC bootloader and I don't want to\nre-flash Android on the TV Box. In fact, this was exactly why I\npurchased this Orange Pi R1 Plus LTS board. So I don't have to go\nthrough this hassle with TV Box. And in the event of Raspberry Pi\nshortage such as right now, I want to switch to alternative single board\ncomputers such as Orange Pi from now on. While support is spotty, they\noutperform the Raspberry Pi and don't *cost an arm and a leg* to buy.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [OpenWrt source\ncode](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/source-code/start)\n\n\\- [OpenWrt Build system\nusage](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"38:Tc1e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"This post is supposed to be an update on the 4G-to-Wifi series\n*Upgrading Grandparents' Wifi* I did previously. But discussing with my\nfamily has led me to contemplate that saying. My country has a similar\none: *cure a healthy pig and make it lame as a result* or *chữa lợn lành\nthành lợn què*.\n\n#### The update\n\nAfter a month of running my grandparents' network on 4G, on April 23\n2023, the project was effectively shut down. The Mi Wifi R3G router was\ninstead connected to SCTV cable Internet, which is rated at 50 Mbps. A\nfew problems rose from the project:\n\n\\- 4G network was unstable. Sure, it worked. But it disconnected every\nfew days, forcing me to reconnect it.\n\n\\- It wasn't as fast as I hoped. When the towel wasn't congested, it\ncould reach 80 Mbps. But most of the time, inconsistent from 15 to 50\nMbps. That wasn't any better than our cable Internet. It could be\nbecause the 4G USB modem is cheap, so the antenna quality wasn't good,\nor it couldn't utilize Carrier Aggregation, which is something you'd\nfind on modern smartphones. My phone can easily reach 190 Mbps download\nout of our nearest towel alone.\n\n\\- Double pay. We already paid for our cable Internet, now I had to pay\nmy own to do this experiment. So it wasn't meant to last.\n\nSo now the 4G modem sits in my inventory, occasionally being pulled out\nof its slumber so I can test it on my laptop for fun. Guess it can only\nbe used as backup.\n\n#### The proverb\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230506/Picture1.png)\n\nMy hobby is interesting. I regularly install, uninstall, dismantle,\nreassemble things more times than I could count. But it comes with\nkarma. I can't stop. Like if there was something to improve\ntechnologically in my house, or there were techs that intrigued me, I\nwould try it out, which usually ends up breaking everything else. Can't\ncount the number of close-calls I had with my devices breaking because\nof the new things I put in, lack of precaution, no backup plan\\... I am\nconstantly reminded by my family \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\". It's\na similar thing I learned when I was still working as a software\ndeveloper. Because a lot of functions in a software are built on top of\neach other, they act like a domino chain. If one falls, every one will\nfall, too. Heck, my 4G-to-wifi project had to be pulled partly because\nof my endless experiments on the Pi router end up breaking the network\nfrom time to time. My family said: \"Enough with this. Return everything\nback to **normal**. You had your fun. If it ain't broke, don't fix it\".\nMaybe they're right. After all, this is just to satisfy my boundless\ncuriosity. Nobody is going to care where they got their Internet from,\nor how fast. They only concern whether it will get them to Facebook. To\nthem, a DNS Server to speed up 1 second of scrolling through posts does\nnothing. It does to me. It makes a 50 Mbps cable Internet feel like it\ncan match the snappiness of a 150 Mbps fiber connection.\n\nI feel like anyone who is an artisan, an engineer, a mechanic, or works\nin the technology sector, may run into something similar to the problem\nI have."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"39:T19ba,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"I am a media consumption enthusiast. Let's just say I watch movies a\nlot. Usually, people like me will have a big home theater setup with a\nlarge TV, a large speaker set, a media player with huge HDD storage. But\nthat sounds like too much work, since you have to update the hard drive\nconstantly with new catalogues. So I built my server out of an old i3\nlaptop, a SSD, 2 HDD lying around with a dock and an Ethernet USB\ndongle. I chose 2.5 Gbps dongle version because I wanted to future-proof\nmy server. But that proved to be my undoing, because the OS I chose for\nmy server, Debian, had an older version of the driver that didn't\nsupport the RTL8156 chipset. It might support an older one, the RTL8153,\nwhich is the 1 Gbps variant. So I searched for its driver. It's quite a\nlittle adventure.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230504/DKMS_flow.webp)\n\n#### First time compiling from source\n\nA Google search for RTL8156 driver for linux led me to the\nmanufacturer's driver page to download the driver. However, the\ncompressed file I downloaded (in this instance .tar.bz2) didn't have any\n.deb file to install. Instead I was left with a bunch of .h, .c files\nwith a Makefile. I thought: \"Wait. This is a source code!\".\n\nSo far, I have mostly installed apps and drivers through apt so this was\na new territory. I did some researches and tried compiling the driver.\nIn the source code folder, I typed:\n\n*make -j4*\n\nWith -j4 being number of jobs to run simultaneously, 4 is the number of\nthreads of my CPU. After it finished, the result was r8152.ko file, a\nkernel module. I plugged in the Ethernet USB. It didn't work. Then I\ntried loading the module into the kernel like [this\narticle](https://www.tecmint.com/load-and-unload-kernel-modules-in-linux/)\nsuggested:\n\n*insmod r8152.ko*\n\nThen it worked. My server recognized it.\n\n*ip a*\n\n*3: enx00e04e3b0ac0: \\\u003cBROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER\\_UP\\\u003e mtu 1500 qdisc\npfifo\\_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000*\n\nI edited the *interface*s file in */etc/network* to assign it a static\naddress by adding:\n\n*allow-hotplug enx00e04e3b0ac0*\n\n*iface enx00e04e3b0ac0 inet static*\n\n*address 192.168.4.3/24*\n\n*gateway 192.168.4.1*\n\nFor then on, I could access my server in my house through that IP,\n*192.168.4.3.*\n\nBut I discovered that:\n\n\\- At start-up, I have to *insmod* like that to load the module. This\nwas solved by simply copying that module to /lib/modules/\\$(uname\n-r)/kernel/drivers/net/usb. Didn't have to *insmod* anymore. But that\nwasn't all.\n\n\\- Every time I update the server with apt update, apt upgrade, and\nthere is a kernel update, I have to compile module from source, copy it\nover again or else I lose the driver. So I often delay updating my\nserver, which is bad because you want to keep your kernel up-to-date on\nbugfix, vulnerabilities.\n\nI needed a way to make it compile every time there is a kernel update.\nSo is there a way?\n\n#### dkms - Dynamic Kernel Module Support\n\nNowadays, I use an Ubuntu desktop as my main driver. I often see\nsomething along the line of dkms for my Nvidia card anytime there is a\nkernel update. After rebooting, the video card still works with the new\nkernel. Naturally, I started looking into this \"dkms\".\n\nAccording to this [article](https://linuxhint.com/dkms-linux/), dkms\n*\"is a framework where device driver source can reside outside the\nkernel source tree so that it is very easy to rebuild modules as you\nupgrade kernels\"*. So this is the stuff I was looking for. The author\nalso encountered dkms similarly to me, but by following guides to\ninstall his Wifi driver.\n\nSo with the source code of my Ethernet USB, I copied it to */usr/src*. I\nalso created a file inside the source code's folder, *dkms.conf* with\nthe following content:\n\n*PACKAGE\\_NAME=\\\"r8152\\\"*\n\n*PACKAGE\\_VERSION=\\\"2.15.0\\\"*\n\n*BUILT\\_MODULE\\_NAME\\[0\\]=\\\"r8152\\\"*\n\n*MAKE=\\\"\\'make\\' -j\\$(nproc) KVER=\\$\\{kernelver\\}\\\"*\n\n*CLEAN=\\\"\\'make\\' clean\\\"*\n\n*DEST\\_MODULE\\_LOCATION\\[0\\]=\\\"/kernel/drivers/net/usb/\\\"*\n\n*AUTOINSTALL=\\\"YES\\\"*\n\nPACKAGE\\_NAME gives the name to the entire package of modules.\n\nPACKAGE\\_VERSION give the version of the entire package of modules being\ninstalled with dkms. These two form the name of the folder that contains\nthe source code, *r8152-2.15.0.\n\nBUILT\\_MODULE\\_NAME gives the name of the module just after it is built.\n\nDEST\\_MODULE\\_LOCATION specifies the destination where a module should\nbe installed to, once compiled. From the example: /lib/modules/\\$(uname\n-r)*/kernel/drivers/net/usb*.\n\nNote that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of \\#\nmust be the same for each of BUILT\\_MODULE\\_NAME and\nDEST\\_MODULE\\_LOCATION and that the numbering should start at 0. So each\nmodule goes with its own destination\n\nMAKE and CLEAN correspond to commands used to run when dkms builds\n(make) the module and cleans up after.\n\nAUTOINSTALL is set to yes so that the service\n/etc/rc.d/init.d/dkms\\_autoinstaller will automatically try to install\nthis module when upgrading kernel.\n\nAfter that, I ran three commands:\n\n\\- *sudo dkms add r8152/2.15.0*\n\n\\- *sudo dkms build r8152/2.15.0*\n\n\\- *sudo dkms install r8152/2.15.0*\n\nAnd it installed the driver to the kernel.

When checking out the best deals from my\ncountry's cell companies, I searched Google for illegitimate websites\ninstead of going straight to the sources. They have a tendency to hide\ntheir promotional data plans deep within the Internet, and only show\nstandard data plans on their websites. I came across a few ones that\ncaught my attention. They all had something to do with free data under\nselected services:\n\n\\- YT30 from Viettel allowed you to watch Youtube videos and didn't\ncount towards your data caps\n\n\\- Big50Y from Vinaphone allowed watching Youtube, Tiktok, using Zalo\napps not counting towards caps and gave you 5 GB per day\n\n\\- Y60, our subject of investigation today, allowed the same things and\ngave you 2GB per day.They came with a requirement of the promotion only\napplies to the Youtube, Tiktok apps.\n\nSo I plan to investigate whether it could be applied to the website, and\ncould it be used on a laptop when tethered to.\n\n#### Preparation\n\nWhen I tried to register Y60 data plan on my Mobifone, I did not qualify\nfor it because it required that I was born before 1995. But I was able\nto register for **G1** data plan, which included free data for the\nfollowing apps: Instagram, ZingTv, Zing MP3, Gmail, Google Drive, Zalo,\nViber, Tiktok, FPT Play. I also found another SIM on Vinaphone to\nregister **GT1** data plan, which included free data for Youtube, VieOn,\nNhaccuatui, Tiktok.\n\nFor Mobifone, they required you to install an app called mobifoneGo.\nThis app would tell you when an app launched is permitted for free data.\nIn addition, it also allows you to buy extra data plans for specific\napps you want free.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230427/mobifonego.jpg)\n\n#### Result\n\nAccording to my findings, mobifoneGo created a VPN that only tunneled\ntraffic through if it was coming from the selected apps. For example, I\nused FPT Play to watch some TV using 4G. When I activated 4G, a VPN\ntunnel was opened and when FPT Play was opened, the program showed a\nnotification stating that I had obtained unlimited data and using FPT\nPlay didn't reduce my data cap. If it had been any other apps, it\nwouldn't have worked and my data cap would be decreased. I tried\nbroadcasting Wifi to my laptop to see if [https://fptplay.vn/](https://fptplay.vn/) counted\nas free data but it didn't work, not even creating a proxy using Every\nProxy to go through the VPN tunnel on the phone solved it. It reduced my\ndata cap. The desktop-sized picture is when I ran out of my data cap.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230427/fpt out of gb with phone.png)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230427/fpt out of gb with proxy pc.jpg)\n\nFor Vinaphone, it was simpler. You would get free data by either visit\nthe website like [https://youtube.com/](https://youtube.com/), [https://tiktok.com/](https://tiktok.com/),\n[https://vieon.vn/](https://vieon.vn/), or use the equivalent apps. However, only Youtube\ngot free data, the rest didn't get free data, it subtracted my data cap.\nI see a false advertising here!\n\n#### Routing table in Android from Mobifone\n\nUtilizing Termux, which is a terminal for Android, I looked for some\ninformation regarding the tunnel.\n\n*ip route show table 0*\n\n\\- With mobifoneGo:\n\n*default dev tun0 table tun0 proto static scope link*\n\n*10.0.0.2 dev tun0 table tun0 proto static scope link*\n\n*default dev dummy0 table dummy0 proto static scope link*\n\n*default via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table rmnet\\_usb0 proto\nstatic*\n\n*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table rmnet\\_usb0 proto static scope\nlink*\n\n*10.51.40.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*10.53.120.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\\_usb0 proto kernel scope link src\n10.100.58.146*\n\n*local 10.0.0.2 dev tun0 table local proto kernel scope host src\n10.0.0.2*\n\n*broadcast 10.100.58.144 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope\nlink src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*local 10.100.58.146 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope host\nsrc 10.100.58.146*\n\n*broadcast 10.100.58.147 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope\nlink src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*\\[\\...\\]*\n\n\\- Without mobifoneGo:\n\n*default dev dummy0 table dummy0 proto static scope link*\n\n*default via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table rmnet\\_usb0 proto\nstatic*\n\n*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table rmnet\\_usb0 proto static scope\nlink*\n\n*10.51.40.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*10.53.120.254 via 10.100.58.145 dev rmnet\\_usb0 src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*10.100.58.144/30 dev rmnet\\_usb0 proto kernel scope link src\n10.100.58.146*\n\n*broadcast 10.100.58.144 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope\nlink src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*local 10.100.58.146 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope host\nsrc 10.100.58.146*\n\n*broadcast 10.100.58.147 dev rmnet\\_usb0 table local proto kernel scope\nlink src 10.100.58.146*\n\n*\\[\\...\\]*\n\nAs you can see, the 4G modem is *rmnet\\_usb0*, the tunnel is *tun0.*\n*tun0* didn't add any new route into the routing table, so I guess this\nis a local VPN that changes the IP header from packets belonging to the\nallowed apps so that Mobifone server can detect some kind of free data\nflag, because it's unlikely for it to tamper with the original content\nof a packet, which was usually encrypted by protocols like HTTPS in APIs\nor video streams.\n\n*traceroute 8.8.8.8*\n\n\\- With mobifoneGo:\n\n*traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets*\n\n*2 10.53.86.53 (10.53.86.53) 32.868 ms 31.891 ms 31.189 ms*\n\n*3 10.53.125.82 (10.53.125.82) 27.192 ms 10.53.125.83 (10.53.125.83)\n26.642 ms 26.123 ms*\n\n*4 10.53.124.88 (10.53.124.88) 25.665 ms 25.177 ms 24.627 ms*\n\n*5 10.53.124.131 (10.53.124.131) 24.017 ms 10.53.124.130 (10.53.124.130)\n23.223 ms 10.53.124.131 (10.53.124.131) 22.370 ms*\n\n*6 10.53.125.103 (10.53.125.103) 21.179 ms 22.430 ms 21.790 ms*\n\n*8 10.53.165.41 (10.53.165.41) 27.832 ms 27.374 ms 26.764 ms*\n\n*9 10.53.119.218 (10.53.119.218) 53.620 ms 53.101 ms 52.582 ms*\n\n*10 142.250.47.38 (142.250.47.38) 51.971 ms 51.422 ms 59.356 ms*\n\n*12 dns.google (8.8.8.8) 57.587 ms 63.294 ms 62.622 ms*\n\n*\\[\\...\\]*\n\n*- Without mobiifoneGo:*\n\n*traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets*\n\n*2 10.53.86.53 (10.53.86.53) 33.631 ms 27.100 ms 26.123 ms*\n\n*3 10.53.125.82 (10.53.125.82) 25.116 ms 24.536 ms 18.127 ms*\n\n*4 10.53.124.88 (10.53.124.88) 17.487 ms 24.567 ms 21.240 ms*\n\n*5 10.53.124.131 (10.53.124.131) 28.382 ms 10.53.124.130 (10.53.124.130)\n27.832 ms 27.221 ms*\n\n*6 10.53.125.102 (10.53.125.102) 26.672 ms 10.53.125.103 (10.53.125.103)\n27.008 ms 26.245 ms*\n\n*7 10.53.165.206 (10.53.165.206) 25.361 ms \\* \\**\n\n*8 10.53.165.41 (10.53.165.41) 27.130 ms 34.577 ms 30.976 ms*\n\n*9 10.53.119.218 (10.53.119.218) 57.739 ms 50.903 ms 50.324 ms*\n\n*10 142.250.47.38 (142.250.47.38) 57.160 ms 65.888 ms 56.335 ms*\n\n*12 dns.google (8.8.8.8) 59.235 ms 62.500 ms 58.167 ms*\n\n*\\[\\...\\]*\n\nThere isn't much change in the way a packet traveled through 4G either\nway.\n\n#### How Vinaphone found out about my free data\n\nAs most traffic is end-to-end encrypted by HTTPS, the only way I see\nVinaphone detect the free data is through reading the destination of a\npacket being sent. They have a IP whitelist for the free-data plan. For\nexample, Youtube had the following IP list when I queried it using my\nDNS Server:\n\n*;; ANSWER SECTION:*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.136*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.93*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.91*\n\n*youtube.com. 120 IN A 64.233.170.190*\n\nSo it's likely Vinaphone allowed these IPs to not reduce my data cap\nwhen I watched videos on them. It worked even when I tethered the phone\nto my laptop to access Youtube on the web browser.\n\n#### Zero-rating and net neutrality\n\nBasically, when you use Internet on your phone through technologies like\n3G, 4G, LTE, you have a data plan ahead with some limit on how much you\ncan consume. And some carriers sell special plans that allow you to\naccess some online services without reducing your data caps, usually\nrelated to video streaming, communication\\... That practice is known as\n**zero-rating**. I got introduced to this concept by chance. First by\ncoming across BIG50Y data plan from Vinaphone, and the word came about\nlater when I was researching on this topic. This practice just showed up\nin Vietnam recently, while had shown up in the US before. Like **Binge\nOn** from T-Mobile that doesn't reduce data cap when you watch videos on\nYoutube, Netflix, HBO\\... but how they go about doing it is [throttling\nbandwidth of **any** videos regardless of\nservices](EFF Confirms: T-Mobile’s Binge On Optimization is Just Throttling, Applies Indiscriminately to All Video).\n\nFacebook also jumped on the zero-rating bandwagon with their own [Free\nBasics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet.org) (internet.org)\nprogram, which granted you free access to Facebook (duh!) and other\nservices that had made deal with Facebook. It used to be deployed in\nthird world nations like India, Myanmar, but has since been removed.\nBecause it's a double-edged sword.\n\nOn the one hand, this exercise goes against net neutrality.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230427/facebook-freebasics-india-1100px.webp)\n\nWhat is net neutrality you may ask? **Net neutrality** is the principle\nthat an ISP has to provide access to all sites, online services with the\nsame speed, same treatments without blocking, slowing down or give\n\"special treatment\" to any others. It's the idea that governs free\nInternet as we now know today. So **zero-rating** is essentially ISP\nplaying favorites to those paying to sponsor your data, whether is\ncontent provider like Youtube, social media like Facebook, or both like\nTiktok. ISP can also play favorites to their own services. Why would you\nwant to watch live streaming on website A when service B, offered by the\nISP, charged nothing and reduced no data cap. Thus creating an unfair\nadvantage to anyone not willing to \"pay-to-win\", as the term from online\ngames goes. The consumers are disincentivized to explore alternative\nsites, leaving \"sponsored\" sites the only choices they have, closing of\nthe Internet to a few sites. [There were surveys conducted in various\ncountries showed that people thought Facebook is the\nInternet](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet).\n\nAnother problem arises is privacy and security concern over the practice\nof checking packet (or packet inspection) to see whether it goes to the\nzero-rated destination, or man-in-the-middle proxy to check its content\nlike Free Basics.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230427/free_basics_proxy.png)\n\nThe practice gives too much power to the ISP, who can now decide which\nservice providers it likes, which it doesn't and limit them.\n\nAn article on\n[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/wtf-is-zero-rating/)\npointed out the logical fallacy I liked about zero-rating. Basically, if\nyou can infinitely watch video on their chosen platform, then there must\nbe enough bandwidth to handle it. If that were true, data caps wouldn't\nbe necessary at all. Which brings the whole zero-rating practice to\nquestion.\n\nThere are, however, arguments to be made about the necessity of\nzero-rating in very poor countries like\n[Laos](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31463249), or continents [in\nAfrica](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/facebook-second-life-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-tech-company-in-africa).\nWhere there isn't enough money to eat, let alone spending it on data and\nInternet, zero-rating at least gives people a chance to learn, a\nplatform for commerce, a tool for cheaper communication, however\nlimited. According to a Reddit comment about Free Basics, [\"it does\ninclude free access to Wikipedia as well as other sites like\nDictionary.com, a translator, BBC News, lots of Indian news sites,\nWikiHow, Unicef and various other sources of health\ninformation.\\\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3z94u3/a_week_after_india_banned_it_facebooks_free/)\nDepriving people of the Internet altogether means losing out on an\nutility we all take for granted today. As a short term solution, it\\'s\nan unequivocal yes. There are an unbelievable number of African\nbusinesses that exist only because of the [Facebook's Free\nBasics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/facebook-second-life-the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-tech-company-in-africa)\nprogram. But calling it \"Digital colonialism\" is not fall from the\ntruth, as [Facebook became the Internet itself in the eyes of a majority\nof\nAfricans](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/facebook-free-basics-internet-africa-mark-zuckerberg).\nHence why it was banned in India.\n\nAnother use case for the practice is free access to public service, such\nas in medical, education, as pointed out by this [blog\npost](https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/is-zero-rating-a-threat-to-human-rights).\nThe Colombian Government sanctioned zero-rated educational services so\nthat students wouldn't miss school during COVID pandemic. The Australian\nand the UK partnered up with mobile carriers to curb misinformation\nabout public health, reduce cost barrier, achieve health equality. \"Not\nonly did the service allow people to use online services to access\nmedical records, book appointments, and other services, but it also\nenabled them to obtain information on several health topics\".\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfY1NKrzqi0?si=UCtLbr28hEZT_oJY](https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfY1NKrzqi0?si=UCtLbr28hEZT_oJY)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAfter a lot of articles, researches on these topics, it's hard for me to\ndecide whether this should be acceptable. I'm pro net-neutrality. I'm\nagainst the idea of a walled-garden for the Internet. But zero-rating\nhas its use, IMHO only for public services or disaster situation. It\nshouldn't be used as a way to stifle competition.\n\n#### Note: Fun fact about T-Mobile's Binge On\n\nIf you check out this\n[article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies),\nElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) did an experiment to check if\nT-Mobile throttled their downloads based on their contents and\nprotocols. From the result, it could be seen that they throttled\nbandwidth **only** when they could **detect** the content type or file\ntype, which was only possible on HTTP because HTTPS encrypted data.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality)\n\n\\- [Zero-rating and what\\'s wrong with\nit?](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/wtf-is-zero-rating/)\n\n\\- [How does an unlimited YouTube data plan work (StreamOn, T-mobile,\nDe)?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-an-unlimited-YouTube-data-plan-work-StreamOn-T-mobile-De-How-does-it-know-if-I-am-streaming-from-a-laptop-connected-at-a-mobile-hotspot-or-if-I-am-watching-from-my-phone-through-the-YouTube-app)\n\n\\- [G1 MobiFone](https://mobifonego.vn/goi-g1-mobifone/)\n\n\\- [GT1 Vinaphone](https://vinaphone.com.vn/di-dong/GT1/)\n\n\\- [Can I get the routing table entry in\nAndroid?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6940973/can-i-get-the-routing-table-entry-in-android)\n\n\\- [Free Basics vs. Free Internet: Your Guide to the Raging Net\nNeutrality\nDebate](https://www.gadgets360.com/internet/features/free-basics-vs-free-internet-your-guide-to-the-raging-net-neutrality-debate-782554)\n\n\\- [Free Basics Technical\nGuidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internet-org/platform-technical-guidelines)\n\n\\- [The Rise and Fall... and Rise Again of Facebook's Free Basics: Civil\nSociety and the Challenge of Resistance to Corporate Connectivity\nProjects](https://globalmedia.mit.edu/2020/04/21/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-facebooks-free-basics-civil-and-the-challenge-of-resistance-to-corporate-connectivity-projects/)\n\n\\- [Is Unlimited Data Really\nUnlimited?](https://unlimitedlteadvanced.com/4g-lte/is-unlimited-data-really-unlimited/)\n\n\\- [It's a battle for internet\nfreedom](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/its-a-battle-for-internet-freedom/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3b:T1d1c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After a blog series about using 4G as house Wifi, I need an short\narticle to breathe a bit. So this is gonna be a short one.\n\n#### Background\n\nLast year, I decided to upgrade the network in my house. My home network\nwas not much to speak of, just a Viettel modem (H646EW) connected to the\npreviously mentioned TP-Link Archer C50. My home server was connected to\nthe network through Wifi, because the router is in the kitchen while the\nserver was in my room adjacent to it, and wiring is out of the question.\nThe router slowly became a bottleneck, as the number of devices\nconnected to it increased and my server had to serve media contents\naround the house as well as download contents from the Internet.\nInternet bandwidth was also increased by the ISP to 150 Mbps and my old\nrouter could not utilized it fully, only averaging 65 Mbps. So I\nreplaced the main router with an Asus RT-AC1300UHP. It's a 2.4/5 GHz\nWifi Router with Gigabit LAN. Its specs include a quad-core Qualcomm\nIPQ4018 ARM processor at 700 MHz, 256 MB RAM, much more powerful than\nthe Archer with single-core Mediatek MT7628A MIPS running at 580 MHz\nwith only 64 MB RAM.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/router-wifi-bang-tan-kep-cong-suat-cao-asus-rt-ac1300uhp-mu-mimo.webp)\n\nI replaced the router by connecting LAN1 from H646EW to WAN of the Asus\nrouter, went in the configuration page of Asus router, changed WAN type\nto DHCP (or in this case Automatic IP). And that was it. Speed test\nusing either speedtest.net or fast.com gave me full 150 Mbps\nsymmetrical.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/asus_wan_dhcp.jpg)\n\nOne day, as I was browsing through Facebook, I came across this group\ntalking about PPPoE and using another router to \"dial\" it instead of the\none provided by the ISP. So it got me thinking: \"What if I can apply it\nto my network then?\"\n\n#### Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) and bridge mode\n\nPPPoE is a network protocol for using PPP on Ethernet. Back in the old\ndays, PPP is used for dial-up Internet access. Nowadays, PPPoE is used\nfor customer authentication, record on DSL network, fiber network. When\nyou register for Internet service, your provider will give you a\nusername for the PPPoE account, and they pre-configured the account in\ntheir modem with the password. Then from the modem, you would connect\nanother, better router to it, use it as the main point to connect to the\nInternet for all devices in your house. The reason is that ISP modems\nare usually weak, unreliable if left to handle anything to heavy. But by\nusing 2 routers, this leads to a situation called \"double NAT\", where\ntraffic coming to and from a client has to route twice before hitting\nthe Internet, increasing latency and causing problems to programs that\nneed to open port. The first drawback is why you would want to turn your\nmodem to bridge mode, so the router has to do most of the heavy lifting,\nthe modem's only job is conversion from fiber to Ethernet. The second\ndownside is kind of meaningless, as in IPv4, you most likely have an IP\naddress given by the ISP, which allows Internet access but the outside\nworld can't connect to you because a lot of users around your house also\nhave that same address (which is a large problem if you want to do\nanything involving P2P like torrenting, VOIP, online gaming. Fixing this\nis a story for another time).\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/asus_wan_dhcp.jpg)\n\nBridge mode essentially turns your modem into a bridge, \"bridge\" the ISP\nend to your router on the other end. It bypasses routing, DHCP of the\nmodem, sends traffic directly to the router.\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\nBefore performing this, I should warn you. When I performed this, I\nlocked myself out of the modem multiple times, lost access to the\nInternet, had to call their technician before resetting the modem fixed\nthe issue so that I could try again. So if your Internet is running\nfine, you shouldn't bother doing this. Maybe you can look into DMZ\nsetting if available.\n\nAnother point is that each modem is different and each ISP is different.\nSome modems may not have bridge mode available. Go through your modem's\nsettings first, talk to the ISP technician if needed before trying this.\n\nAdditionally, your router must be more powerful than your modem to go\nthrough this procedure. Because dialing PPPoE is a single-threaded task\n\\[1\\].\n\n#### How to do it?\n\nFirst, we need to change the modem to bridge mode. This depends on\nmodel, so these steps is for my Viettel GPON modem H646EW.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/CexU8EHlQ-0?si=KBSVzC9e2At7m7se](https://www.youtube.com/embed/CexU8EHlQ-0?si=KBSVzC9e2At7m7se)\n\nLogin to the configuration page using [https://192.168.1.1/](https://192.168.1.1/). Turn it\ninto Advanced Mode. First go to Advanced Setup on the left panel -\\\u003e LAN\nsettings to disable DHCP and Wifi Setup to disable Wifi on the modem.\n\nThen go to Advanced Setup -\\\u003e WAN Connections.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h39m19s620.png)\n\nClick Edit on any profile that is PPPoE mode if your ISP doesn't give\nyou your credential when registering for Internet service. It contains\nyour credential.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h39m37s389.png)\n\nRight click on the Password text box and click Inspect Element. Find the\n\\\u003cinput\\\u003e tag that points to the Password box, change type from\n\"PASSWORD\" to \"text\". It shall reveal your PPPoE password. Copy PPPoE\nusername and password, set status to Deactivated and click Apply.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h40m15s589.png)\n\nBack at WAN Connections, we add a new entry, Bridge Mode, then click\nAdd.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h41m38s057.png)\n\nSet status to Activated. IP choose IPv4/IPv6. At 802.1q, you have 2\noptions:\n\n\\- Tag VLAN at the modem: VLAN 35 for Viettel\n\n\\- Passthrough: pass VLAN Tagging to the router. You can usually find\nthis option under IPTV\n\nFor demonstration, I chose tagging VLAN at the modem.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/vlcsnap-2023-04-15-19h41m38s057.png)\n\nAfter that, look under the modem for its MAC address. Then connect the\nmodem LAN1 to WAN of the router. For this instance, it's an Asus\nRT-AC1300UHP. Login to Asus configuration page at [http://192.168.0.1/](http://192.168.0.1/).\nGo to Advanced Settings -\\\u003e WAN. Change WAN Connection Type to PPPoE.\nFill in your PPPoE username and password. At Special Requirement from\nISP, set No to all and put MAC address the address you found under the\nmodem. Then click Apply. The router should now dial directly to ISP to\nget Internet service, instead of going through routing from the modem.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/asus_wan_pppoe_1.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230415/asus_wan_pppoe_2.jpg)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Facebook wifi technology\ncommunity](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vntik/)\n\n\\-\n[RT-AC1300UHP](https://cellphones.com.vn/router-wifi-bang-tan-kep-cong-suat-cao-asus-rt-ac1300uhp-mu-mimo.html)\n\n\\- [Wikipedia - Point-to-point over\nEthernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet)\n\n\\- [Why do ISPs still use PPPoATM or PPPoE instead of\n802.1x?](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/t16fnc/why_do_isps_still_use_pppoatm_or_pppoe_instead_of/)\n\n\\- [What\\'s Double NAT and why do I want to avoid\nit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/8tl0wv/whats_double_nat_and_why_do_i_want_to_avoid_it/)\n\n\\- [\\[1\\] Is PPPOE wan\nsingle-threaded?](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=156753)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3c:T22c1,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"So. Here we are. The third part of the long-running series where I try\nto improve my Internet condition. So no point beating around the bushes.\nI plan to transform my 4G connection into Wifi using whatever was\navailable to me, because I'm a cheapskate that refuse to spend money,\nbut had no problem spending it on a thermometer, then broke it by\nputting it in a freezer. I also enjoy learning how networking works, as\nI always thought that a router is like a magic box. It was when I got an\nAsus router, turned on ssh that I discovered routers are all Linux\nboxes.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\nTo prepare for this job, I dug up my old Raspberry Pi 3. I haven't had\nmuch use for it since my HP laptop took over the server work from the\nboard. It has 4 USB port and a LAN port. My plan was to turn this board\ninto a router. Just a router, not one of those combo things that you\ncommonly find. The LAN port would be connected to a Wifi access point\n(AP). For the USB port, I plugged a 4G USB Modem with a SIM card placed\nin.\n\nThe TP-Link Archer C50 router currrently in use would be turned into AP\nin place of a router. The reason was that the Raspberry Pi has a weak\nWifi chip, it couldn't transmit very far, not like a dedicated device\nwould. Moreover, I didn't need its routing function.\n\nThe 4G USB Modem would be a Sony Xperia Z. I borrowed it for this job\nbecause it wasn't in use and it could install a custom ROM or OS, free\nfrom restrictions of the original ROM. I used Lineage OS 16, which was\nAndroid 9 for the phone. Android 9 and later allows you to set your\nphone to USB tethering mode as default anytime it is connected via USB.\n\nA 4GB or higher micro SD card was needed to install a router OS of your\nchoice. In this case, OpenWrt.\n\nLocation. You need to get as close as possible to a cell tower from your\nhouse. This would require you to use a phone with the SIM card you want\nto use as the source to find a cell tower that belongs to the SIM\nnetwork. You can check signal strength by going to Settings -\\\u003e About\nphone -\\\u003e SIM Status or something similar. Keep an eye on the negative\nnumber and dBm. The higher the number (lower number in negative) the\nbetter the signal. You can also use speedtest.net or fast.com to make a\nquick speed test.\n\n#### Preparing the router\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/OpenWrt_Logo.svg)\n\nThe reason I chose OpenWrt for my router OS is that, while it's\nintriguing to DIY by using Raspbian and set everything up using iptables\nfor NAT, ufw for firewall, dnsmasq for DNS, DHCP, it's a lot of work to\nset it up separately. Instead, OpenWrt offers a web UI (luci) to help\nyou set everything up quickly. I also wanted to try it out on a real\nscenario, as before this I ran it on my virtual machine to get a feel of\nthe OS.\n\nGo to the download page of OpenWrt, get the latest version, with target\nas bcm27xx -\\\u003e bcm2710 (Raspberry Pi 3 SoC). They offer 2 choice,\next4-factory or squashfs-factory. I chose ext4 due to ease of use, as I\ncan use GParted to expand the data partition to full. squashfs takes\nmore steps, and has to be done in terminal. I might try out squashfs\nversion later, because that's the version normally used in modified\nrouters. After downloading the gzip file, extract it to get the image\n(img) file. Use either balenaEtcher or dd command to flash it to the SD\ncard (sda in this example):\n\n*dd if=openwrt.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M*\n\nAfter that, put the card in the Pi, plug in the power and boot it\nup.Connect to your Pi using LAN and open the browser, type in\n[http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/) (default IP of the LAN interface) with username\nroot, no password to enter OpenWrt management.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/1.jpg)\n\nFirst, we need to install some additional packages. Go to Network -\\\u003e\nWireless. Press Scan on a wireless interface to connect to an access\npoint.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/8.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/9.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/10.jpg)\n\nType in password of that Wifi AP and submit. On the next page, you can\njust press Save, as that page only matters when you create an AP from\nthis board. Press Save \u0026 Apply. Now go to Network -\\\u003e Interfaces. You\nshould see another interface added in.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/11.jpg)\n\nNow go to System -\\\u003e Software and update lists. You have to do this at\nevery restart when you want to install new packages.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/7.jpg)\n\nYou need to install these packages to use the 4G USB Modem, in this case\nan Android phone.\n\n#### Preparing the access point\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/config_ac50_dhcp.jpg)\n\nThere are 2 ways around this. Either set this router into Access Point\nmode, or you can turn off DHCP Server, which is a function that hands\nout IP address to devices connecting to it. I chose the latter, because\nI never had much luck with the former. Every time I try putting a router\ninto AP mode, I end up resetting it at the end due to not being able to\naccess its configuration page. But you do you.\n\nAfter that, use an Ethernet cable, connect Raspberry Pi to any LAN port\non the TP-Link router, or either LAN / WAN if you choose AP mode.\n\n#### Finding place to put the \"combo\" device\n\nAs I previously mentioned, location is important when it comes to 4G\nconnection. In my case, the house is situated near a cell tower, right\noutside the kitchen's window.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/anten.jpg)\n\nSo the obvious answer is to place the router, the access point, the\nmodem in the kitchen, right? Well, yeah. I put the combo in a chair at\nfirst, and also tried to elevate the phone using the Pi as leverage.\nThat way the phone could get the best signal. It was a sight to behold.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/combo.jpg)\n\n2 weeks after that, I got a dock to prop the phone up properly so it\nlooked more professional and moved the combo to the top of the fridge,\ncloser to the cell tower. By placing it there, I got -89 dBm, as opposed\nto -95 dBm on the chair. It was not much, because this was an old phone,\nbut good enough to work.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/phone_fridge.jpg)\n\n#### Getting the router to connect to the Internet\n\nPlugging the phone to the Raspberry Pi, I had to register the phone as a\nnetwork interface on OpenWrt. Go to Network -\\\u003e Interfaces. Click Add\nNew Interface. Name the interface. Choose DHCP client as protocol,\nbecause you will get IP address from the USB-tethered phone. In device,\nchoose usb0 and click Create Interface. On the next screen, pick\nFirewall Settings, assign the interface to wan zone then Save. After\nthat, click Save \u0026 Apply. So instead of cable Internet, I connected to\nthe Internet via 4G network.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/3.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/5.jpg)\n\nIf you prefer to use your custom DNS, go to 4G interface, Advanced\nSettings, uncheck Use DNS servers advertised by peer. Then go to Network\n-\\\u003e DHCP and DNS. Fill in your desired DNS in DNS forwardings (remember\nto press plus) then Save \u0026 Apply.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/pi_router/12.jpg)\n\n#### Result\n\nSo far so good. It worked like a dream. The Internet was a lot better.\nAnd thanks to the Raspberry Pi having a better CPU than most routers, it\ncould withstand more clients connecting to the network and route better.\nOn early morning or late night, I could get up to 80 Mbps download.\nSpeed is inconsistent throughout the day, ranging from 15 to 50 Mbps.\nBut overall, it's more stable than the cable Internet.\n\n#### Improvements\n\nAbout 3 weeks into the project, I swapped the phone for a 4G USB Modem,\nbecause doing this heated up the phone considerably and had a negative\nimpact to its battery. It's a cheap no-name one because I wasn't gonna\nfully commit to this project. It also improved signal strength, getting\nit up to -76 dBm.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/IMG_20230410_103017_860.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/4g_router/4g_1.2.jpg)\n\nI also slowly phased out the TP-Link + Pi combo in favor of a Xiaomi Mi\nWiFi R3G v1. It's a router with MT7621 SoC with dual-core 880 MHz MIPS\nprocessor, 256 MB RAM, 128MB ROM. Compared to Raspberry Pi, it's like\nDavid vs Goliath. But it does feature hardware routing capability, so\nthat's neat. It runs OpenWrt with 4G USB Modem support, so I could plug\nthe USB Modem in and be done with it. Same performance with 1 less\ndevice to worry about.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230413/IMG_20230411_083037_638.jpg)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [OpenWrt Downloads](https://downloads.openwrt.org/)\n\n\\- [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)\n\n\\- [LineageOS 16.0 for Xperia\nZ](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-final-9-0-lineageos-16-0-for-xperia-z.3924175/)\n\n\\- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model\nB+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)\n\n\\- [Xiaomi Mi WiFi R3G](https://openwrt.org/toh/xiaomi/mir3g)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3d:T269d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"There seems to be confusions surrounding common devices the Internet\nservice provider (ISP) gives. A lot of terms get thrown around: modem,\nwireless router, 5 GHz, 1200 Mbps\\... I want to offer my assistance to\nhelp alleviate this problem.\n\n#### Modem\n\nIf you were born before the explosion of the Internet, you would\nencounter this device before, or at least know what it did to your\ntelephone line when you were on the Internet.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/usr815668d-56k-message-modem.jpg)\n\nA modem is a modulator/demodulator unit, responsible for converting data\nfrom digital signal into analog one. Digital data usually goes inside\nthe device, where as analog ones happen outside, on transmission like\nphone line, fiber, coaxial cable. The unit seen on the picture is a\ndial-up modem, used to connect a computer to the Internet via telephone\nline, the same line you use to call another telephone. The dial-up modem\ndials to a specific phone number (ex: 1269 back in my day), performs\nhandshake with the ISP's modem, and finally start transmitting data\nbetween themselves. During this time, you can't use the telephone,\nbecause the modem has already taken it.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgTxFLHcuKc?si=V1IbEYuKT28f9yqF](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgTxFLHcuKc?si=V1IbEYuKT28f9yqF)\n\nLater, people were able to utilize frequency bands above the band used\nfor telephone. That gave birth to ADSL, or Asymmetrical Digital\nSubscriber Line. With a DSL filter, often called splitter, the frequency\nbands are isolated, permitting a single telephone line to be used for\nboth ADSL service and telephone calls at the same time as 2 lines.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/adsl-splitter.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/DSL-520B-yback.png)\n\nPictured above is the back of a typical ADSL modem, D-link 520b. Its\nmain feature is the 2 ports: DSL and LAN. As around this time, USB and\nEthernet became the standard. You plug the DSL port with the cable from\na splitter at the computer port's end, LAN to the computer. This modem\nacts as both a modem, transferring data to and from ISP by the cable,\nand a router, connecting the Internet to you and handing out an IP\naddress for your computer.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/internet-adsl-viettel.png)\n\nBack then, it costed a fair bit of cash to have ADSL at home, so only a\nhandful of families got their hands on this. Still, this beat 56 kbps of\ndial-up any day. The price above was from quite later as ADSL adoption\nhad slowed down and fiber started showing up. For my family, we paid by\nMB we used, so I used to have a software that counted the MB and billed\nit based on the hour of day. I often torrented at midnight because it\nwas cheaper then.\n\nBut then came fiber optic, or FTTH (fiber to the home). It was promised\nto be the next big thing in Vietnamese Internet. For the first time, we\nwere able to get symmetrical speed, like 25 down 25 up, instead of 3\ndown 0.5 up (Mbps) like ADSL. It is increasingly important, as more\nactivities you can do on the Net with a larger upload speed. The ping of\nfiber being lower also helps online gaming, VOIP services such as Zalo,\nMessenger, Viber, Telegram won the favors of people over free voice and\nvideo calls.\n\nAccording to Quora \\[1\\], there seems to be answers at odds with each\nother over whether Optical Network Terminal (ONT) should be called a\nmodem. In my humble opinion, it should be called a modem, since even\nlight can be considered analog. Fiber uses light as a mean to transmit\ndata to and from ISP.\n\n#### Router\n\nWhen I installed fiber Internet back in 2015, this is what they gave me.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/h646ew.jpg)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/h646ew_under.jpeg)\n\nThis is Dasan H646EW, a GPON ONT with 2.4 GHz Wifi. There's a lot of\nconflicting information about which of the 4 ports has Gigabit Ethernet,\nand which doesn't. As far as I know, port 1 has Gigabit Ethernet. The\ndevice is once again, a combo device that is a modem + a switch (due to\n4 ports present) + a router + a wireless access point.\n\nYou may be wondering why there is a separate section for routers. That\nis because devices like H646EW are all collectively called routers. But\nthey are more like a combination of various hardware then just routers.\nBy definition, a router is a networking device that forwards data\npackets (routes, if you will) from a computer host or network to another\ncomputer host or network. Nowadays, they often sell wireless router\ncombos because they are an all-in-one, setup-and-forget solution for an\naverage consumer.\n\nDue to being a jack-of-all-trade, they only do a good enough job as a\nrouter, an access point. Anything that needs better performance, like\nfarther Wifi range, faster routing speed, a technical user should\nconsider separating each function to individual hardware. For instance,\nISP router + your own router. For better range in Wifi, ISP router +\nspecialized router + access points. ISP router are kept around due to\nrequirements from the ISP. I didn't use the ISP router and opted to use\nmy own. First, it's the Tenda AC10, then the TP-Link Archer C50, both\n2.4/5 GHz 1200 Mbps Wifi routers. Tenda AC10 was defective so that's why\nI replaced it.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/tenda-ac10.png)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/Archer-C50_UN_4.0-01_normal_1515392726561m.jpg)\n\nThe 2.4/5 GHz represents the bands that the Wifi router can broadcast,\nin this case 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. 1200 Mbps **is the aggregated speed of\nboth bands**:\n\n\\- 300 Mbps is from 2.4 GHz. Each antenna sends and receives signal with\na 40 MHz channel at 150 Mbps, so 2 antennae is 300 Mbps\n\n\\- Similarly, 900 Mbps is from 5 GHz. Each antenna sends and receives\nsignal with a 80 MHz channel at 433 Mbps, so 2 antennae is 867 Mbps,\nwhich rounds up to 900 Mbps for marketing purposes.\n\n\\- Do note that this speed is theoretical. By using my phone, which has\n1 antenna for Wifi, to test iperf3, at 2.4 GHz 40 MHz channel is around\n100 Mbps, at 5 GHz 80 MHz channel is around 240 Mbps. Your mileage may\nvary.\n\nBack in 2015, my fiber speed was 25 Mbps, so with 100 Mbps WAN port it\nwas enough. But in 2021, with fiber reaching 150 Mbps and my server\nneeding faster wireless performance to serve movies around the house, it\nwas upgraded to the Asus RT-AC1300UHP. It has a quad core ARM CPU, which\ntrumps over MIPS CPU of the previous router in performance, as well as\nbetter broadcasting range. Around this time, I joined a Facebook\ncommunity and they hinted at a possibility for a better performance if I\nwere to turn off routing on the modem by using what is called \"Bridge\nMode\". So now routing is done by the Asus router as it is connected\ndirectly to the ISP, while the modem is simply passing the signal along.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/RT-AC1300UHP.png)\n\n#### Converter\n\nTo put it simply, media converters terminate the fiber, turn fiber optic\nsignal to that of Ethernet for a single port connecting to a router. It\nshould not be confused with ONT because the converter has no regard for\nthings like IP, VLAN, MAC \\[2\\].\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/media-converter.jpeg)\n\n#### Cable modem\n\nWhy does this belong here? Because in Vietnam, hardly anyone wants to\nuse cable Internet. It feels like an afterthought of any cable service\nprovider. Unlike in the USA where it's one of the main ways to get\nInternet with speed up to 1 Gbps, the fastest in Vietnam is with SCTV at\n200 Mbps, while with Viettel you get 300 Mbps symmetrical plus TV for a\ncheaper price. And the quality of Internet is cable is worse than fiber.\n\nCable Internet uses a standard known as DOCSIS (Data-over-Cable Service\nInterface Specifications). It was developed by CableLabs. DOCSIS works\nby utilizing TV channels on a coaxial cable to transfer data. Pre-DOCSIS\n3.0, it was only using 1 channel for download, 1 for upload. DOCSIS 3.0\nonwards can bond channels to increase bandwidth available to consumers.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/IMG_20230330_085715_959.jpg)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230404/docsis-bond.png)\n\nThe modem is a mplus CBC383, a Cable to Ethernet modem from Korea. It\nsupports 8 channels bonding downstream, 4 channels bonding upstream and\nGigabit Ethernet. Looking at its configuration page at\n[http://192.168.100.1/](http://192.168.100.1/), it was clear that the modem bonded 8 channels\nfor downloading, 2 channels for uploading. It can run very fast, but\ncurrently my grandparents' house is on a 50 Mbps plan from SCTV.\n\nSome small notes:\n\n\\- I think the reasons for the poor performance of cable Internet are\ncompany negligence and deprioritization during national Internet\nbandwidth shortage.\n\n\\- Wifi, Bluetooth, your cell phone also use modems to send and receive\ndata.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Modem vs Router - What\\'s the\ndifference?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y)\n\n\\- [Fiber vs Cable (Coaxial) or ONT vs\nModem](https://dongknows.com/fiber-vs-cable-internet-docsis-modem-vs-ont/)\n\n\\- [Wikipedia - Modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem)\n\n\\- [TP-Link Archer C50\nv4](https://www.tp-link.com/vn/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-c50/v4/)\n\n\\- [Asus\nRT-AC1300UHP](https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/wifi-routers/asus-wifi-routers/rt-ac1300uhp/)\n\n\\- [Facebook wifi technology\ncommunity](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vntik/)\n\n\\- [Docsis 3-0 CBC383 CABLE MODEM\nSpecs](https://www.tradekorea.com/product/detail/P621075/Docsis-3-0-CBC383-CABLE-MODEM.html)\n\n\\- [What is DOCSIS?](https://networkshardware.com/what-is-docsis/)\n\n\\- [SCTV Price](https://www.sctv.com.vn/bang-gia-dich-vu)\n\n\\- [Viettel Fiber](https://www.viettelcapquang.vn/)\n\n\\- [\\[1\\] Quora - Is ONT a\nmodem?](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-ONT-a-modem)\n\n\\- [\\[2\\] Quora - Can I use a media converter + SFP to bypass using a\nmodem?](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-a-media-converter-SFP-to-bypass-using-a-modem-I-have-500mbps-fiber-optics-FTTH-What-SFP-will-work-best)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3e:T260f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"There is something about the idea of connecting to the World Wide Web\nanytime, anywhere, on the go that always entice me. I remember staring\nhours to a tiny screen of a Samsung slide phone when I was 7 because it\nhad 2G connection on it, and wasted 700.000 VND. It was a massive amount\nof money in 2003. I had a memory in somewhere between 09 and 10 when I\nwas in possession of a Nokia E72 and get to use wifi for the first time.\nIt was like when men first discovered fire. It was magical. Of course,\nbeing that young, I didn't think those will revolutionize the way we use\nthe Internet like today.\n\nAfter a brief stint with using 4G on PC, I was hooked. So again I\nsearched the Internet whether anyone had tried something similar and\nwhat was their experience like. I found out about a whole section of the\nInternet dedicated to finding alternative ways to connect to the\nInternet. A few of them are No Contract, Rural Internet subreddit on\nReddit.com.

While fiber connection are slow, unstable,\n4G connection are better due to the remaining bandwidth being preferred\nfor 4G over fiber.\n\nHowever, **using 4G as home Internet should be considered a niche, a\ntemporary solution because**:\n\n\\- Cell towers are not designed to handle large traffic. If lots of\npeople use 4G as home Internet and downloading large amount of data, it\nwill eat up bandwidth of everyone else also using that cell tower on\ntheir phones. This is much like how wifi would drop connections when\nthere are many devices connected, even if the uplink is fast enough to\nsupport all. That's the reason why in large events, major conventions,\nmobile cell sites are deployed on-premise to increase bandwidth\navailable to consumers at the location.\n\n\\- High latency makes it hard to use any applications that demand low\nresponse time. Online gaming is out of the question, unless you are a\nmasochist that enjoy playing at \\\u003e80 ms ping at times. VOIP, most say it\nalso suffers. However, for me it actually improves, due to our network\nprioritizing traffic.\n\n\\- Inconsistent speed. This largely depends on your location, distance\nand obstacles to the nearest tower, tower bandwidth availability. For\nexample, my phone could reach 170 Mbps with a tower in my viewing\ndistance, but drop to 40 Mbps when it was a few kms from a nearest\ntower.\n\n\\- High barrier of entry. Equipments for fiber connection like routers,\nmodems are quite easy to find, even given for free by the ISPs (at least\nthe modem), while 4G ones have to be sourced by various places, with\nprices often twice of that of fiber ones.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/xe-phat-song-luu-dong-san-sang-khong-de-nghen-mang-dip-tet-2018-2.jpg)\n\nNevertheless, that hasn't stopped anyone from turning it to a reality.\nSo here are several ways to use 4G as an Internet source for your home:\n\n#### 4G/Wifi USB Adapter\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/usb-4g-wifi.jpg)\nThis is a device that takes a SIM, connects to the Internet via 4G and\nbroadcast it via 2.4 Ghz wifi. It is powered via USB, plugging to either\na charger or a portable battery. It can also be plugged into a PC,\nlaptop and used much like the USB Tethering function from Android.\n\nThere are 2 categories for the device:\n\n\\- Made by brand like ZTE, Huawei\n\n\\- No name or lesser known name like Olax (from ZTE), Jazz, NetMax.\n\nThe device on the picture is a no name brand. This is usually a Qualcomm\nMSM8916 (Snapdragon 410) Android board repurposed to a 4G/Wifi USB\nAdapter, so it behaves much like an Android phone with no screen. Some\ncomes with a more limited MDM9600 chipset \\[1\\].\n\nSome devices don't come with wifi hotspot function, and must be plugged\nto a PC to connect to the Internet.\n\nBe cautious when using this as a hotspot. As it has to pull double duty,\nconnecting to the Internet via 4G (which can heat up the device\nsignificantly) and broadcasting it via Wifi, it can break down easily.\n\n#### Wifi Hotspot (or Mifi)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/olax-mt10.jpg)\n\nThis is a device that works similarly to the 4G USB Adapter, but it has\nits own battery. I'm not sure whether this device supports USB\nTethering.\n\n#### 4G/Wifi USB Adapter and a separate router supporting USB\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/router-usb.jpg)\n\nThis is connecting the 4G USB Adapter to a router supporting Internet\nconnection via USB. The router must have drivers to run the USB, either\nunique for the USB or the RNDIS driver, which is used by Android phones\nand no name 4G USB. This way has the best chance of success if the\nrouter is running a custom firmware, for example OpenWrt, Padavan, as\nthey often come with the drivers preinstalled.\n\n#### Phone and a separate router supporting USB\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/phone-router.jpg)\n\nThis is connecting an Android phone to a router supporting Internet\nconnection via USB. It must have the RNDIS driver preinstalled for this\nway to work. Custom firmwares like OpenWrt, Padavan are recommended. It\nis best to use any phone with Android 9 or later, as it has a function\nthat defaults its USB connection to tethering mode anytime the phone is\nconnected via USB to another device.\n\nTo do this, make sure your Android phone has the developer options\nalready turned on. If not, go to **About phone** in **Settings**, find\n**Build number** and press 7 times. After that, get to **Developer\nOptions**. Find **Default USB configuration** in the **Networking**\ncategory. And choose **USB tethering**. Now anytime your phone is\nconnected to a router via USB, it will be in tethering mode. Even in the\nevent of a blackout, when power returns, your phone will connect to the\nrouter as a 4G USB Adapter.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/Screenshot_20230331-143353.png)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/Screenshot_20230331-143356.png)\n\n#### Dedicated WWAN Box and a separate router supporting USB\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/wwan-box.png)\n\nFor those hardcore enthusiasts who want to commit to 4G home Internet,\nthis is the option for you. This is a M.2 to USB adapter, commonly known\nas WWAN Box. It takes in a M.2 WWAN card, usually found in laptop with\n4G capability, and convert it to USB mode. It supports 2 external\nantennae for better signal reception.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/wwan-box-inner.jpg)\n\nSome typical M.2 WWAN Card:\n\n\\- Sierra Wireless EM7345, EM7430, EM7455\n\n\\- Quectel EC20, EC25\n\n\\- Fibocom L860\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/em7455.jpg)\n\nSome cards need re-flashing their firmware to receive your SIM properly.\nYou can follow Jeff Geerling's article \\[3\\] about that. He also talked\nabout the different protocols the card use to interact with the router:\nQMI, MBIM, ECM\\... This is important if you want to setup this card for\nuse in OS like Ubuntu, Raspbian.\n\nFor OpenWrt, there are packages used to interact with the card. You can\ncheck out video \\[2\\], \\[4\\] for more information on how to setup\nconnection using QMI and MBIM mode.\n\n#### Dedicated 4G Router (also called 4G network gateway)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/CPE-R311-PRO-1.jpg)\n\nManufacturers created these products as an all-in-one solution for 4G\nhome Internet. Just slot in the 4G SIM and it will create a wifi access\npoint for you to connect your devices. These devices are often just your\nrun-of-the-mill wireless router, slapped in a 4G modem chip. Here are\npictures of Tenda 4G06 disassembly, courtesy of Fccid.io. 4G06 uses\nQuectel EC25 as the modem.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/Picture1.png)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/Picture2.png)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230331/Picture3.png)\n\nCurrently only Mobifone offers their 4G home Internet service, MobiWifi,\nthough they are very quiet about it. Their modem is a Huawei B311 with a\nspecialized SIM that only grants unlimited data to their device. The\n2.4/5 GHz devices are pricier than their 2.4 GHz counterpart. I'll\nadvise you to buy a gateway and a router separately so that you can have\nan easier time troubleshooting.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [No Contract subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/)\n\n\\- [Rural Internet subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rural_Internet/)\n\n\\- [XDA Developers Fourm](https://forum.xda-developers.com/)\n\n\\- [vozforum\n4G](https://voz.vn/t/cong-dong-4g-5g-cong-nghe-di-dong-thac-mac-khoe-hang-danh-gia-cho-het-vao-day.563346/)\n\n\\- [Mobile cell sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_cell_sites)\n\n\\- [Facebook wifi technology\ncommunity](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vntik/)\n\n\\- [WifiShop](https://wifishop.vn/)\n\n\\- [Tenda 4G06](https://www.tendacn.com/product/4g06.html)\n\n\\- [MobiWifi](https://mobiwifi.vn/)\n\n\\- [Fccid - Tenda 4G06 Internal\nPhotos](https://fccid.io/V7T4G06/Internal-Photos/Internal-Photos-5421535)\n\n\\- [\\[1\\] Hackable \\$20 Modem Combines LTE And Pi Zero W2\nPower](https://hackaday.com/2022/08/03/hackable-20-modem-combines-lte-and-pi-zero-w2-power/)\n\n\\- [[\\[2\\] Process of making WWAN Box Router\nCombo]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUM87vjO9Ao)\n\n\\- [\\[3\\] Jeff Geerling - Using 4G LTE wireless modems on a Raspberry\nPi](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/using-4g-lte-wireless-modems-on-raspberry-pi)\n\n\\- [\\[4\\] OpenWRT - Install and Configure LTE modem in QMI\nmode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRddwfZ_TBY)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3f:T115a,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Have you ever got a feeling that you would never go back once you tried\nsomething that was way better than you expected? That was my feeling\nonce I replaced my router to an Asus one and get a taste of my fiber's\nmaximum speed of 150 Mbps, as opposed to 90 Mbps limited by TP-Link'\nancient hardware. Or that time I replaced my DSL connection to fiber\nback in 2015. From 3 Mbps to 25 Mbps was a massive jump I couldn't\nbelieve I didn't agree to have it earlier. But I was always a skeptic\ntowards new technologies.\n\nIn early 2023, I was tasked with taking care of my grandparents. So I\ngot some clothes, my laptop, my phone, my TV box and moved to my\ngrandparents' house. During this time, I was preparing my documents and\nsubmitting them to various universities for a chance to study Masters in\nthe USA. And using SCTV's \"excellent\" Internet service was an exercise\nin frustration. Every time I tried to access any web that was from the\nUS, it would either hang, or chug along. You would need a massive\ntolerance for slowness to stand the kind of speed that makes the Chrome\n(or Firefox if you're like me) tab spin round and round. I have to use\nmy VPN server, which is on Viettel Data Center, as a proxy to at least\nmitigate it. Being used to fiber, this was unacceptable. I asked my\nfamily to change ISP and their answer was no, which is understandable.\nSCTV's cable + Internet combo monthly rate was 220.000 VND, my fiber\nalone was worth that much.\n\nAround this time, I came across an interesting offer from a new cell\ncompany.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-2/so-sánh-mạng-internet-2g-3g-4g-5g.jpg)\n\nI'm no stranger to using cellular network for Internet. I knew of its\nexistence back in the early days of Vietnamese Internet. It was 2G\nnetwork when I was 7 with my dad's Samsung slide phone. Back when it was\nridiculously expensive because there was no data plan, you were billed\nby kilobyte so it was more of a novelty then a necessity like today.\nI've come to use it frequently since the day I got my first my\nsmartphone, which was back in 2014, with my country utilizing 3G\nnetwork, superseding 2G. 4G came about in 2016 or so. The three major\ncell networks: Viettel, Mobifone, Vinaphone, rolled out the carpet to\nwelcome the new standard. I chose Viettel at the time because as a\ncollege student, money is pretty tight. So 30.000 VND/2,5 GB is a\nreasonable data plan as I do not use social media much at the time and\nYoutube could be watched at home. In 2019, iTel, a MVNO (mobile virtual\nnetwork operator) using Vinaphone as backbone, launched with a plan:\n77.000 VND for 3GB per day. I only found out in 2021 through a flyer at\nthe post office, because MVNOs here aren't known for their massive ad\ncampaigns. Wanting to give it a test drive, I bought a sim and gave it\nto my sister, who used Facebook more than I do. She said it was good and\ndidn't feel restricted by other networks' limited data caps. For\nreferences, 3GB/day equals to 90GB/month, far exceeded anything that\nwere offered at the time. The other networks soon followed up with their\nown monthly \"data cap per day\" mode like this. Then I stumbled upon a\ndata plan of Vinaphone: 500GB for 150.000 VND. That sounded good enough\nto me, and I'm not one to pass up an offer that good. So I bought a\nVinaphone sim, replaced my aging Viettel one with it, and tested the\nnetwork. It was good, though signal is a bit weak compared to Viettel.\nThe data plan also comes with 5 Mbps if exceeded. I've been using\nVinaphone on my phone ever since.\n\nBack to grandparents' Internet story. I used my phone as a hotspot and\ncontinue my work. It was faster, around 80-150 Mbps down due to my place\nnear a cell tower and had a faster response to any website I visited,\nespecially those US university websites that were hard to get to.\n\nI used a VSmart Live 4 with Android 11, which has an interface that is\nclosest to being pure Android compared to Samsung. First, you have to\nturn on 4G and turn off wifi. Next, go to Settings -\\\u003e Cellular -\\\u003e\nHotspot \u0026 Tethering. And turn on Wifi hotspot or USB Tethering,\ndepending on your need.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-2/screen1.png)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-2/screen2.png)\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-2/screen3.png)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [The MAY Plan of\niTel](https://itel.vn/tin-tuc/tin-tuc-itel/sim-itel-goi-may)\n\n\\- [U1500 500GB SIM from\nVinaphone](https://cellphones.com.vn/sim-4g-vinaphone-u1500-500gb-thang-12-thang.html)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"40:T1392,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Hi, you may not know me. That's fair, this is my first blog after all.\nYou can call me The Testing Guy. For most of my life, computer has been\na major part of my life and my passion. I eat, sleep computer. I play\ngames, do homework, read news, watch Youtube on it like most people. I\nhave also done a lot of experiments, odd projects on computers and\nvarious hardware throughout the years, but never documented them. May be\nbecause of laziness, or maybe it's just easier to remember the things\nyou really like to do (and also the things you really hate too). After\nan meeting with my friends yesterday, I have come to realize that:\n\n\\- Most of the people from my background have also done various personal\njobs like that.\n\n\\- That a lot of projects I've done sound like magic to everyone else,\nincluding my family, despite them coming off as sometimes rather\nmundane.\n\nSo today I decide to write a blog about my various adventures (and\nmisadventures) in past, present, and maybe future.\n\nLike most folks around the world, in Vietnam, we watch television. In\nparticular, we watch it through cable. There are many cable TV providers\nin Vietnam: VTV, HTVC from the government, SCTV of Saigontourist (yes, a\ntourism company is also a cable provider), VTC. There are ISP like FPT,\nViettel, VNPT who also wanted a piece of television business and started\njumping in. My family chose SCTV, because it was one of the first\ncompanies to provide cable TV, and has stuck with them since. My\ngrandparents also chose them as the cable provider, along with the\nInternet service they provide as a combo. The reason for the included\nInternet is that on weekends, we visit our grandparents and need some\nconnectivity for our Facebook and Youtube video consumption. My cousin,\nwho is working towards her college degree, also lives with our\ngrandparents and needs Internet to do her homework. Their speed is about\n35 Mbps symmetrical (up and down speed is the same), which is not much\ncompared to my fiber at home, 150 Mbps symmetrical, but is good enough\nfor the purpose. They provided us a router and a modem.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-1/IMG_20230330_085715_959.jpg)\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-1/IMG_20230303_143405_861.jpg)\n\nAccording to my findings, the modem is a mplus CBC383, a Cable to\nEthernet modem from Korea. And the router is a standard-issue TP-Link\nTL-WR841N, a 2.4Ghz 300 Mbps Wifi router you'll likely find cheap at a\nused market somewhere.\n\nSCTV installed it for us and it was working. So all is right with the\nworld. Or is it? A common wisdom I picked up over the years as a\nsomewhat network enthusiast is that you should never use any equipment\nprovided by your ISP. That proved to be true in this case. We installed\nthe Internet portion back in 2019. During its lifetime, I have cursed it\nnumerous time as it disconnected, it hung, forcing everyone to use 4g\nfrom their phones as substitute more than once. I did try to go into the\nconfiguration page of the router to change and/or reset it (the modem's\nis inaccessible). So by 2022, I had enough. I decided to replace the\nTP-Link one with another one from my house. That one was previously\nreplaced by an Asus router.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-1/Archer-C50_UN_4.0-01_normal_1515392726561m.jpg)\n\nThis is the TP-Link Archer C50, a 2.4/5 GHz 1200 Mbps Wifi router.\nAnyone reading the specs might find that it only has a 100 Mbps WAN for\nmy 150 Mbps fiber. The story is I bought this back in 2014 as a\nreplacement for a Tenda router. After replacing this with an Asus one,\nMr. Archer is left without a job. So I gave him a new one. Because the\nInternet of SCTV is only 35Mbps symmetrical, it's a non-issue.\n\nI pulled the plug out of the WR841N, installed Mr. Archer in by plugging\nthe ethernet cable from the modem to the WAN port, access the router's\nconfiguration page and change the wifi's name to match the previous\nrouter's settings and done.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-1/config-ac50-ap.jpg)\n\nFast forward a month, the Internet at my grandparents' house has\nimproved dramatically. Of course there were hiccups here and there while\nbrowsing Facebook. I figured it was because I hadn't put something in\ncorrectly so back to the config page I went. This time to DNS Settings.\n\n![](/images/blog/Tech/23/230330-1/config-ac50-dhcp.jpg)\n\nI first tried Google DNS (8.8.8.8), because that's the first that comes\nto anyone's mind whenever they think their Internet is slow. A short\nwhile later I changed it to Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) because when I ping\nit, response time was 17 ms, much faster than Google's \\\u003e60 ms. It did\nimprove the situation, and made the Internet a bit smoother overall.\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Docsis 3-0 CBC383 CABLE MODEM\nSpecs](https://www.tradekorea.com/product/detail/P621075/Docsis-3-0-CBC383-CABLE-MODEM.html)\n\n\\- [TP-Link\nTL-WR841N](https://www.tp-link.com/vn/home-networking/wifi-router/tl-wr841n/#specifications)\n\n\\- [TP-Link Archer C50\nv4](https://www.tp-link.com/vn/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-c50/v4/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"47:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"bB_dy8pqBnRs1hZv6AeEb\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"mb-8 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tighter\",\"children\":\"Brian Phan\"}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"flex flex-col md:flex-row mb-8 home-section\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"mr-4\",\"style\":{\"flex\":1},\"children\":[\"$\",\"img\",null,{\"src\":\"/images/about/portrait.jpg\"}]}],[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"style\":{\"flex\":2,\"marginLeft\":\"1rem\"},\"children\":[[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"mb-4\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"span\",null,{\"className\":\"italic\",\"children\":\"”It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.
