just got a new second job at my college, Oregon State U. You wouldn't believe\njust how hard it was to get a job here. I not only had to compete with international\nstudents, but also native students here for just a job, not just tech-related jobs.\nOut of two dozens job I had applied, about seven are rejection letters, others I didn't\nreceive any replies. My first job was working at the Memorial Union as a food worker.\nWhile I enjoyed the work, I still preferred working with machines more than humans so\nalways looking forward to dish room duty, ironically. But currently, I am working as a\nWeb Content Assistant for the Outdoor School of OSU Extension Service. I am thankful for\nthe opportunity working manual labor job, though. It gives me more appreciation for the\npeople working these types of job, and how much they have to put up with.\n\nNow, why did I title this post **A different mindset**? Well, my job consists of moving\ncontents from the old web page, made in Umbraco, to the new site, made in Drupal. But I\nam not allowed to touch any codes. Like, I am told to make the new contents closest to the\nold ones' look under new guidelines of the new site. Knowing this made me realize what my\nemployer meant when they said I was overqualified for the job. So now I can't think of the\nweb in terms of codes, inner structures and workings of the site. Only its contents matter.\nDoesn't matter if they won't match design in the end, as long as they are brought over under\nnew design patterns. I do my job, afterward recap all I have done back to the project manager. We will have\nweekly meeting every Wednesday, same as my previous job. In fact, I was the one who brought\nup the weekly meeting idea, a thing I usually did in my developer routine.\n\nIt took some time getting used to this role. It's an odd feeling. Like, I used to be the one behind\nhow the web looked. I was both frontend and backend. The old job's page, I was the one to make\nchanges directly, with the full power of programming. And now, making web with *Legos*,\nbuttons and clicks. You want to add button, there's a button for that. You want three columns, *button*.\nI wasn't even allowed to touch *HTML mode* to align three buttons to be on the same row. I had to get creative with this limitation, and added an extra three-column row so they are aligned. I can only do this job similar\nto how most people running a website would do when they aren't as proficient in programming as I am.\n\nI could understand the reasoning behind this limited power. The design is decided by a higher power.\nSo it's wise not to mess with it too much. But hey, a tech job is a tech job. After so many rejections,\nI'm just happy to take whatever counts as computer job. And who knows? Doing this job well, I might be\nconsidered to be put on the Salesforce team, or become one of the developers. That is, if they still have\na slot. Working here means a foot in the door of tech employment here. One for my resume.\n\n*Life is good.*"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8:Tc07,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After not working for a while as a full stack developer, I got a new\njob. Now I\\'m about to be a web developer, again. This time, I will,\nalong with a team, manage a website running a content management system\n(CMS), Drupal. Since I have never dealt with CMS, or PHP, before, this\nis a new venture for me. In preparation for this new job, I have watched\ntutorials, reinstalled Docker and many containers, done some works.\nLet\\'s say I\\'m excited to come back to programming. I guess having a\njob does push you to be more motivated.\n\nDuring my preparation, my brain just wondered somewhere. I typed in\nGoogle \\\".net vs javascript\\\" and stumbled upon a post in\n[Reddit](https://www.blogger.com/). I discovered there is such a thing\nas NET Minimal API, similar to the one I deployed on my server as a\nmusic, file server over HTTP on ExpressJS a while ago. This got me\nthinking a bit so I searched \\\"NET Minimal API\\\" on Google and there was\na tutorial for minimal API with .NET by\n[Microsoft](https://www.blogger.com/). I was surprised.\n\nWhen I was still working as a Full Stack Developer for my old place, I\n**hated** their .NET Core codebase. Because at the time, I didn\\'t\nunderstand what MVC was for, and many more intricacies in the underlying\nstructure of their codebase. I often argued with their senior developer\nabout the necessity of such baggage like interface, dependency\ninjection. To this day, I still can\\'t see the reason. Maybe because\nI\\'m ignorant to them, or I don\\'t have the view of the bigger picture,\nas most my web applications are quite small, a simple ExpressJS with a\ncouple of APIs should do it. That\\'s why I was ecstatic when we move on\nto other backend frameworks. My favorite at the time was NestJS. It was\nbuilt upon ExpressJS, so right up my alley. And since a new codebase\nmeant moving on from legacy baggages, no more problems from .NET Core\nhaunting me. Another thing I hated was I couldn\\'t program the .NET\nserver on Linux, I could only use Windows with Visual Studio, a behemoth\nIDE that ate up all of 12GB ram whenever I wanted to debug the program.\nI could never find ways to debug on VS Code, better yet, create a new\n.NET Web API project. Now with the discovery of .NET\\'s command line,\nmaybe those could be done on Linux.\n\nBut that got me to reflect on myself. What if I had figured this out\nsooner, would I still hate .NET as much as I did before. Maybe I would\nhave enjoyed the framework, because the language C\\# syntax is much\nbetter than Java. I had difficulty working with LINQ before slowly it\nbecoming my favorite thing when dealing with array of objects. It has\ntwo ways of doing things: query-like SQL or method (callback). I used\nthe method way back then. My greatest achievement on LINQ was using that\nand my then-newfound knowledge of garbage collection to create about 10\nmillion records for a table on MySQL daily. That job used to belong to a\nMySQL stored procedure, which runs for hours. My new way took 5 minutes\nto run. I always wondered whether the result was correct every time it\nran but no one seemed to complain."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9:Tb0b,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"To be honest, with all the claims from Microsoft that S Mode is supposed\nto represent performance and security, it is still Windows.

But the store is pretty lacking in terms of\napplications that you want to use in your everyday task. The part you'll\nprobably hate is that you're forced to use Edge as the web browser, and\nyou can't switch to a different search engine except Bing. Luckily, I\ngot around it using Alt+Home key shortcut with Google as the homepage.\nIf your laptop doesn't come preinstalled with Microsoft 365, you have to\nuse any number of subpar office suites on the store to compensate.\n\nYou can switch out of S Mode by asking Settings for it. I tend to do\nthat later, so I can rip any remaining bundlewares off my laptop,\nespecially McAfee. For now, using S Mode is like a dare for me, to me\nhow far I can stand it. It's quite good so far. I got Office\npreinstalled, Edge is alright, lighter than Firefox, can install\nextensions from either Edge or Chrome. When I need to connect to a Linux\nbox, there is a ssh client called PuTTY that somebody ported to the\nstore. No Visual Studio Code, so I settle for Code Writer on the store\nand use that Linux box to compile code for me. But my patience is\nrunning low.\n\n#### First time running Windows without using a Microsoft account\n\nNote: I tried this trick on Windows S Mode. This trick DOES NOT WORK ON\nS MODE, because Terminal, or Command Prompt doesn't work on S Mode.\n\nPress Shift+F10 while in the Out-Of-Box-Experience, the interface anyone\nwho first starts their laptop would see. Type in *oobe\\\\bypassnro* and\nrestart the computer. Then when the setup asks for an Internet\nconnection, click on *I don't have Internet* option.\n\nFor S Mode: you can enter no\\@thankyou.com as the username and a random\npassword, which causes the login to fail, allowing local account setup.\n\n#### Some tricks in Registry Editor to improve performance\n\nDisable Widgets, so that even with update, it will NEVER be turned on:  \n*HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\*  \nCreate Dsh key.

But Jeff Geerling, a Youtuber I\nfollow, posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NJ6V8i1Xd8)\nabout deploying your own VPN to access your server from a remote\nlocation, and I feel like I must write my own experience on the matter.\n\n#### The differences in my approach\n\nAccording to Mr. Geerling, he had a public IP (though not static) and\npointed his domain to this IP to connect to his network using Wireguard\ninstalled by PiVPN. I do not have such luxury, as my public IP is\n10.x.x.x through PPPoE to my ISP, Viettel, so using his way was out of\nthe question. I am stuck in a situation known as CGNAT. What's more, he\nexposed ALL his network out, which, to each of their own, is quite\ndangerous as the VPN can be used as an attack vector to your own\nnetwork. I did a similar thing while creating my own VOIP service using\nAsterisk, but it only lasted a day, and I quickly closed it due to the\ndanger behind it. PiVPN, the tool he used, is quite fascinating and I\nwill look into it in the future. But back when I built my VPN, it was on\na virtual server, and I built it manually. I didn't know any automated\ntool like his, I just followed some guides from DigitalOcean to set up\nWireguard, along with fail2ban, ssh. In fact, the reason I chose\nWireguard was that it was easier to set up. OpenVPN has a lot of moving\nparts needed to run, while Wireguard only requires a pair of keys.\nGranted, there are\n[scripts](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install) that help\ninstall OpenVPN, but the performance is OpenVPN's Achilles's heel. I\nonly have 1 vCPU, so performance is kind of a big deal. Lastly, his\nvideo mentioned \"a little extra security on public Wifi\" and \"bypass\ncontent restriction\". While my VPN can't bypass any content restriction,\nit can provide encryption for my traffic on public Wifi, in addition to\nproviding its own DNS server to speed up DNS query.\n\n#### CGNAT (carrier-grade network address translation)\n\nA blog [post](https://www.draytek.co.uk/information/blog/what-is-cgnat)\non Draytek explains this well, but to quote from a\n[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/hi2sde/i_just_learned_my_internet_connection_is_cgnat_is/)\ncomment as a short version: \"CGNAT means your ISP doesn\\'t have enough\npublic IPv4 addresses to assign one to each user. So they are\nessentially doing to you what your home router does to the Internet by\ngiving you a NAT\\'ed IP address. Yes, that means you can\\'t run your own\nservers or forward traffic at home\". My situation may not technically be\nCGNAT, could be simply double NAT from my end and my ISP's, because my\n\"public\" IP is not in the CGNAT address block, which is usually from\n100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255, is 10.x.x.x. I first noticed this\nphenomenon in 2014, when I installed fiber. Though back then I didn't\nknow how to bridge the ISP router to my TP-Link router, I knew of double\nNAT and opened similar port on both routers to torrent. However, I\nchecked on [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org/) and they couldn't see the open\nport. The torrent could still download, but it couldn't upload. It was\nstrange, because before that, I could see the open port when I was still\non ADSL (also double NAT). It was my biggest achievement back in 8^th^\ngrade, to open port and torrent, or host my own radio using Windows\nMedia Encoder. The second biggest was getting 3D games to run on my\nPentium 4 computer.\n\n#### Setting up virtual server\n\nThere are a lot of options when choosing a virtual server provider. I\nchose Viettel IDC because it was the closest to home, and I also use\ntheir fiber service. I bought 1 vCore with 1GB RAM, 20GB SSD, 300 Mbps\nunlimited bandwidth. I chose Ubuntu Server as the base OS, because I'm\nused to Debian-based OS. I guess the way to choose your preferences\nworks the same in other providers, whether AWS, GCP, Linode\\...\n\nSome steps I performed before setting up WIreguard:\n\n\\- Install ssh to have remote access, instead of using console from\nbrowser. Change ssh port, only allow access with key\n\n\\- Configure firewall using\n[ufw](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-20-04):\nDeny all incoming, allow ssh port, Wireguard port\n\n\\- Install\n[fail2ban](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-fail2ban-works-to-protect-services-on-a-linux-server)\nto limit amount of login attempts\n\n#### Setting up Wireguard\n\nI followed this\n[guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-wireguard-on-ubuntu-20-04)\non how to set up Wireguard Server. First, I generated 2 pairs of keys,\none for the server, one for the client using the commands:\n\n*wg genkey \\| sudo tee /etc/wireguard/private.key*\n\n*sudo cat /etc/wireguard/private.key \\| wg pubkey \\| sudo tee\n/etc/wireguard/public.key*\n\nFollowing that, I had to choose a subnet. Since 192.168.0.x, 1.x are all\ntoo common, I chose anything from 2.x and up. After that, I went to\n*/etc/wireguard/*. I created a config file for my VPN, *wg0.conf*\n\n*\\[Interface\\]*\n\n*Address = 192.168.13.1/24*\n\n*PostUp = ufw allow 51820/udp*\n\n*PostUp = ufw route allow in on wg0*\n\n*PreDown = ufw delete allow 51820/udp*\n\n*PreDown = ufw route delete allow in on wg0*\n\n*ListenPort = 51820*\n\n*PrivateKey = \\\u003cserver private key here\\\u003e*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]*\n\n*PublicKey = \\\u003cclient public key here\\\u003e*\n\n*AllowedIPs = 192.168.13.2/32*\n\n*\\[Interface\\]* is configurations for your own VPN interface, whether\nit's a server or a client. *PostUp* and *PreDown* are commands to run\n\u003cins\u003eafter\u003c/ins\u003e turning on the VPN server and \u003cins\u003ebefore\u003c/ins\u003e\nshutting down server, respectively. I set up a bunch of commands that\nopen port, allow traffic running inside VPN and vice versa when turning\noff server. *\\[Peer\\]* are configurations for clients that will connect\nto the server. Each *\\[Peer\\]* adds another client to the server.\n*AllowedIPs* is where you type in the client's VPN IP address. If the\nclient also acts as a router to another subnet, for instance,\n192.168.0.x, you can add *192.168.0.0/24* and you can access that subnet\nfrom the VPN.\n\nOn my home server, not the virtual one. I also created a config file in\n*/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf*:\n\n*\\[Interface\\]*\n\n*PrivateKey = \\\u003cclient private key here\\\u003e*\n\n*Address = 192.168.13.2/24*\n\n*DNS = 8.8.8.8*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]*\n\n*PublicKey = \\\u003cserver public key here\\\u003e*\n\n*AllowedIPs = 192.168.13.0/24*\n\n*Endpoint = \\\u003cserver real IP\\\u003e:51820*\n\n*PersistentKeepalive = 25*\n\n*\\[Peer\\]* here means something different. For a client to connect to a\nserver, it only needs 1 peer. For *Endpoint*, you need to pinpoint the\nvirtual server's IP address. *PersistentKeepalive* is necessary to keep\nthe connection up, as we are running essentially a tunnel from the\nvirtual server to the real one. If the client isn't a server, that part\nwon't be needed.\n\nOn both servers, I typed in *wg-quick up wg0*. I pinged from each side\nwith the other's IP address and it worked.\n\n![](/images/240902-1/wireguard_8070_8878.png)\n\nReferences:\n\n\\- [Jeef Geerling - Build your own private WireGuard VPN with\nPiVPN](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/build-your-own-private-wireguard-vpn-pivpn)\n\n\\- [Information about icanhazip.com, you can use ident.me\ninstead](https://blog.apnic.net/2021/06/17/how-a-small-free-ip-tool-survived/)\n\n\\- [ELI5: How does NAT (Network Address Translation)\nwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1wqc30/eli5_how_does_nat_network_address_translation_work/)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"b:T1880,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"It's very nice to have something powerful in a compact form, like a\ngaming laptop, when your job requires a heavy workload. But when your\njob requires you constantly in a meeting, only doing spreadsheets on a\nday-to-day basis, or if you are a student, sitting at lectures on end,\nthen a gaming laptop may not be for you because its battery life is\nhorrible. I mean, 3-4 hours is nice, only if you do not run any heavy\nworkload, or else it will drop to 1-1.5 hours. That's why I'm searching\nfor this *elusive* 8-hour battery laptop. I asked about it in a local\nelectronic retail store. They said it doesn't exist, only about 6 hours\nor so. Not planning to give up, I scoured the Internet to find something\nlike that.\n\n#### Low-powered solutions\n\nI came up with some solutions:\n\n\\- A laptop with a low-powered x86 CPU: like Atom (N3350, N4000, N5000,\nN4020, N5100, N6000), or m-series (m3)\n\n\\- A laptop with an ARM CPU: from MediaTek (MT8183, ...) or Qualcomm\n(7c, 7c gen 2, SQx family)\n\nAnother consideration is the operating system (OS) running on the\nlaptop. It's more important on ARM laptops because MediaTek CPUs are\nonly on ChromeOS, while Qualcomm ones are available on either ChromeOS\nor Windows. But using an ARM laptop is quite limited, especially on\nWindows, as you are constricted by the number of applications written\nfor the architecture. It's quite small. While battery life on ARM\nlaptops is vastly superior to that of x86 laptops, it doesn't matter if\nthere isn't any app for them. So, I leaned towards x86 ones. And today,\nI got a chance to try out a Chromebook.\n\nThis article is written using that same Chromebook, on Microsoft 365,\nbecause I'm more used to Office than Google Docs.\n\n#### What is Chromebook?\n\nChromebook, simply put, is a laptop with ChromeOS as the default OS.\nUnlike most OSes, it only works when connected to the Internet, even\nthough Google is trying to rectify that by allowing Android apps and\nLinux apps to be installed. The focus of the entire OS is the web\nbrowser, Chrome, which powers the OS as well. With the web browser, you\ncan, of course, browse the web. You can also install and run web apps. A\nChromebook utilizes its own cloud solution for most tasks, like office\nwith Google Docs, file storage with Google Drive (there is an internal\nstorage with a file manager). ChromeOS was built loosely on Gentoo\nLinux. I said *loosely*, because there isn't much Linux inside ChromeOS.\nMost commands are removed by Google. As the purpose of this OS is for\nweb browsing only, it's very light, and can run on some of the weakest\nhardware, say Celeron or Pentium, or cheap ARM cores. Although compared\nto Linux, not lighter by much. But much lighter than Windows by 3 GB of\nRAM.\n\n![](/images/231011/top.png)\n\n![](/images/231011/System_rest.png)\n\n#### My thought on Chromebook\n\nThe one I borrowed was a [HP\nChromebook](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-Chromebook-13-G1-Core-m3.215846.0.html)\nrunning [Intel Core\nm3-6y30](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/88198/intel-core-m36y30-processor-4m-cache-up-to-2-20-ghz.html)\nand 4 GB of RAM. It came out in 2016-2017 so it is quite old already. So\nmy experience will revolve around this one.\n\n\\- Keyboard lacking some keys for text editing: Home, End, Page Up /\nDown, no Function keys. Start (Super on Linux) key is gone, replaced\nwith Search key which replaces the Caps Lock for no reason. Why not just\nreplace the Start key and leave the Caps Lock alone? Those missing keys\nhave been replaced by shortcuts found by pressing **Ctrl+Alt+/** on the\nkeyboard to show off the shortcut list\n\n\\- Ran surprisingly fast on only 4GB of RAM. Could be because this\nmachine has the Android portion disabled by the organization I borrowed\nfrom\n\n\\- It's quite warm on the underside when working hard because there's no\ncooling fan (these low-powered chips don't usually have fans), but most\nof the time it's cool\n\n\\- Battery lasted about 6-7 hours, much longer than my gaming laptop. If\nrunning a heavy webpage, I think it could run for 2-3 hours\n\n\\- Lightweight. You can carry it with you like a tablet. But the same\ncan be said for Windows laptops of the same specs. But they probably run\nmuch hotter due to being a heavier OS *compared to ChromeOS*\n\n![](/images/231011//IMG_20230922_115538_030.jpg)\n\n![](/images/231011/IMG_20230922_115555_363.jpg)\n\n\\- File manager is very basic. It's like they took the codebase of\nGoogle Drive and used it as basis for the file manager\n\n![](/images/231011/filemanager.png)\n\n\\- There's a terminal but it's hidden. You can access it using\n**Ctrl+Alt+T**, just like in Linux (which is funny, ChromeOS is loosely\nbased on Gentoo Linux). But it's quite limited in command. Type\n**help\\_advanced** to show off all commands available on ChromeOS\n\n**-** Settings: When you pull the scrollbar, the menu heading doesn't\nfollow you, which is quite useless as the function of a heading should\nbe. To be fair, Windows's Settings flaw is when you return to the\nprevious page, it doesn't *automatically scroll you to the previous\ncheckpoint*. **WHY IS IT so hard for them to design a decent Settings\napp??? They made it work ON ANDROID**\n\n**-** My Chromebook is old, so its GPU doesn't support the newest\ncodecs. Playing Youtube videos, if I leave it to run as is, the browser\ndefaults to VP9 and eats up 45% CPU. So I installed h264ify to switch\ncodec to H264 and pull the CPU usage down.\n\n![](/images/231011/system_h264.png)\n\n\\- AUE: This is the biggest downside of using ChomeOS. There is an\nexpiry date, just like MacOS. When it hits the date, it won't receive\nany more updates from Google, even the browser, as the browser is\n**coupled with the OS. Yes, very WISE DECISION.** May have been\ndeliberate for planned obsolescence. There was news regarding\n[separating the two\napart](https://chromeunboxed.com/chromeos-116-transition-lacros-chrome-browser-seamless/),\nbut it remains to be seen what Google is planning. Does it allow to\nupdate the browser indefinitely, or just a few versions apart from the\nOS? As for my Chromebook, the update is no more, as it is expired. Still\nusable, if you don't have any concern regarding security\n\nI will be on the lookout for any Windows laptop running this CPU or\nsimilar and compare their performance and battery life."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"c:T9d3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"For the longest time, I was scared of using UEFI on my PC. With the\nexception of my laptops, which force me to use UEFI though I disabled\nSecure Boot because it's a pain to deal with, I have been using CSM mode\n(compatibility mode) that simulates BIOS. Lately with a new hard drive\nto test various Linux OSes on, I've decided to reinstall Windows 10\ninside the PC on UEFI mode, so on the new Linux hard drive I can install\nmultiple OSes without having their bootloaders stepping on each other\nlike in the BIOS age.\n\n#### Howto\n\nI learned this from [this\narticle](https://askubuntu.com/questions/509423/which-commands-to-convert-a-ubuntu-bios-install-to-efi-uefi-without-boot-repair)\nin StackExchange. These steps apply too, I guess, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch,\nor anything using GRUB as bootloader. Tldr, we *chroot* into the root\ndirectory *of the OS you want to convert*, run some commands and GRUB is\nrestored.\n\nFirst, I checked to see whether the machine is on UEFI mode using this\ncommand:\n\n*\\[ -d /sys/firmware/efi \\] \u0026\u0026 echo UEFI \\|\\| echo BIOS*\n\nProceed if it says UEFI, otherwise go into the BIOS menu and change it.\n\nAfterward, I mapped some partitions into the root directory of the OS\nthat is on the way to be converted (supposed that *sda1* is the OS\npartition, *sda2* is the EFI system partition, */mnt* is where you want\nto chroot to, could be anywhere else):\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt*\n\n*sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/efi*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /dev /mnt/dev*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /proc /mnt/proc*\n\n*sudo mount \\--bind /sys /mnt/sys*\n\n*sudo* mount *\\--bind /run /mnt/run*\n\nLater on, I loaded a module called *efivarfs* (UEFI Runtime Variables\nSupport) using *sudo modprobe efivarfs*. Then I went in using *sudo\nchroot /mnt*.\n\nNow, depend on the OS, say Ubuntu or Fedora, you use their respective\npackage manager. For my case, that was apt. So:\n\n*apt update \u0026\u0026 apt list grub\\**\n\nCheck for package *grub-efi* and *grub-efi-amd64*\n(*grub-efi-amd64-signed* if Secure Boot was enabled, I didn't try it).\nAnd then I went:\n\n*grub-install \\--target=x86\\_64-efi \\--efi-directory=/boot/efi\n\\--bootloader-id=ubuntu \\--recheck \\--no-floppy \\--debug*\n\nAlternatively, [this\narticle](https://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi)\nsuggests reinstalling *grub-efi*.

Another was EndeavourOS, based on Arch Linux. A\nfew things I learned while using Fedora Workstation, which was using\nGNOME as its desktop environment (DE).\n\n#### Choice of desktop environment\n\nOf all the distros I tried, they all shared similar desktop\nenvironments. Some can have multiple distros, each made with a different\nDE:\n\n\\- GNOME: probably the most mature of all. It's fast, plenty of\nanimation, its design is quite professional. Except the concept is\ndifferent. It's thinking desktop in term of workspaces, so each\napplication gets their own desktop. There's no minimize button, no\nmaximize except double-clicking to do so. The Windows key (or Super key)\nbecomes a central key for most actions on the desktop. You use this to\nswitch back and forth between workspaces. GNOME takes 2^nd^ place in\nterms of memory consumption, close to KDE.\n\n\\- KDE: probably the one I liked the least. While quite polished like\nGNOME and Windows-like, it's a bit buggy, a bit too many customizations\nin Settings so quite cumbersome to use. It's also a bit laggy and heavy,\nheavier than GNOME. For Fedora cold boot, KDE desktop takes 1.5 GB RAM,\nwhile GNOME about 1.2 GB RAM. Small different but KDE is not as fast as\nGNOME.\n\n\\- Xfce: Lightweight, fast, comparable to LXQt so they both share the\nsame spot. I happen to like LXQt more due to being a Lubuntu user\ninstead of Xubuntu. The latter\n\n\\- MATE: If you enjoy the look of old GNOME from back in '09, then use\nMATE. Like Xfce and LXQt, quite light on the resource.\n\n\\- Cinnamon: Linux Mint's own implementation of GNOME, Windows-like,\nlight, fast. One of my favorite next to LXQt.\n\nNote that this is my opinion on these DEs as their original forms,\ninstead of the customized looks that can be made by other distros. See\n[Xero Linux](https://xerolinux.xyz/) for KDE or\n[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) for Xfce,\n[ZorinOS](https://zorin.com/) for GNOME, Xfce.\n\n#### Display Protocol\n\nAs of the time of writing, there exists two protocols: X11 and Wayland.\n[Wayland](https://dudemanguy.github.io/blog/posts/2022-06-10-wayland-xorg/wayland-xorg.html)\nis still in development and supposed to supersede X11, which has existed\nsince [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System). I tried\nWayland out in GNOME on Fedora and here are a few things I found:\n\n\\- Firefox finally utilized Nvidia GPU for video decoding through\n[nvidia-vaapi-driver](https://github.com/elFarto/nvidia-vaapi-driver). I\ntried numerous times on Lubuntu, which uses X11, and it didn't work. I\ncan finally watch 4K content on YouTube, though Iwill probably disable\nAV1 playback on Firefox because my GPU doesn't support AV1 codec.\n\n\\- There's no fractional scaling on GNOME, AFAIK. There's only integer\nscaling (200%, \\...)\n\n\\- No custom resolution. I used that on Nvidia because they never\nsupport my resolution 1600x900, which is supported on Windows. It's only\navailable on X11.\n\n\\- Performance on [Cemu](http://cemu.info/) is noticeably slower on\nWayland than on X11. This is achieved using the Vulkan backend with GTX\n1060 and Ryzen 5 1600. It's also\n[darker](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/142s10n/is_nvida_making_cemu_darker_on_wayland/).\nThe advice on Reddit was to avoid Wayland for this application due to a\nmissing function in Vulkan.\n\n#### Package Management\n\nFedora includes GNOME software center for installing and updating apps\nas well as the OS. This is way easier, more intuitive, and has more apps\nthan using Discover, its equivalent on my Lubuntu or KDE-based distros.\n\nIf you are a hardcore and want to use the terminal then **dnf** is the\nequivalent of apt:\n\n\\- At every first run when you open the terminal, dnf caches the\nrepository's package list. It's quite annoying, slow (because I haven't\nfigured out how to change mirror but I digress). But anytime you need to\nremove a package, you don't have to *autoremove* all of its dependencies\nlike in Ubuntu, it will do it for you.\n\n#### Codec\n\nUnlike other distros, Fedora doesn't include the popular video codecs\nout-of-the-box: H264, H265 for instace. That puts a damper on the first\nimpression of anybody using Fedora. You won't be able to play any videos\nusing these codecs on the Video app (Totem) or Firefox without first\ninstalling OpenH264, and you can forget about watching H265. Lucky\nYouTube uses VP9, which is open-source so you can still watch it on\nFirefox. Installing my usual app for watching video with Nvidia Hardware\nDecoding, Celluloid, which uses\n[mpv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/xe0p52/psa_mpv_is_now_available_on_fedora_37/)\nand\n[ffmpeg](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/cant-install-codecs/73797/5)\nas backend, didn't play H264 using hardware decoding because the codec I\ninstalled didn't support it, and of course no H265. VLC, however,\nworked. It decoded H264, H265 normally. But that was because they used\ntheir own ffmpeg to do it. Using Celluloid on Flatpak, which is a\ncontainer format for storing applications, I was able to play videos\nusing hardware decoding. Celluloid on Flatpak packages its own\ndependencies, which means its own mpv and ffmpeg with support for\nhardware decoding.\n\n#### Fixing UEFI bootloader\n\nReinstall packages related to GRUB instead of running *grub-install\n--target=x86\\_64-efi* like in Ubuntu/Debian\n\n#### Microsoft Core Fonts (Arial, Times New Roman)\n\nThis one depends on preferences, but I installed these fonts so that I\ncan use the docs files exported from LibreOffice Writer on Microsoft\nWord. For Ubuntu/Debian, you can install the *ttf-mscorefonts-installer*\npackage.

So I plan to try out a couple of\noperating systems (OS) bare metal instead of using virtual machines, so\nthat I can see how it feels.\n\n#### Windows 11\n\nThis is the first one I tried out. First off, I couldn't flash its ISO\nfile onto the USB on Linux. I guess Windows ISO are built different. So\nI used [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) from Windows to flash it. The\nprogram supports bypassing Windows 11's lousy requirements, which are\nTPM (Trusted Platform Module), Secure Boot, 4GB RAM minimum. While it's\namazing that they include those in Rufus, I didn't really need it as\nWindows 11 ISO I got was from undisclosed sources, they've already\nscrubbed off those requirements. While installing, when you get to the\nadding user screen, MAKE SURE not to connect to the Internet, if you\nwish not to login your Microsoft account and create a local account.\nAfter all installation steps, I started using Windows 11 and here is\nwhat I found:\n\n\\- Normal cold boot of Windows 11 took about 15 seconds, compared to\nWindows 10's 7 seconds. So it's slower, not a good start.\n\n\\- By default, the Start Menu is situated in the middle of the Taskbar.\nThat aggravated me, because for the last 30 years, Start Menu has always\nbeen on the left of the screen. That was the standard. And now they\ndecided to move it for poorly justified reasons.\n\n\\- Taskbar's right click menu misses a lot of the options found in\nWindows 10, especially Task Manager. Normally I hold Ctrl + Shift + Esc\nto open it, but it reminds people that it exists when they right-click\non the Taskbar.\n\n\\- Settings seems to have improved a lot after Windows 10, which has a\nlacking Settings app. However, it's still no substitution for Control\nPanel. I found myself still using it on Windows 10 and 11.\n\n\\- Right click menu is limited because menu was shorten with only few\nselections, copy, paste had turned into icons. I presumed this is for\ntouchscreen, but dang it I was on a desktop. I had to\n[hack](https://www.theverge.com/23707964/windows-11-regedit-registry-menu-how-to)\nit to restore the previous menu.\n\nIn short, I went back to Windows 10 after a day. But it's no use.\nWindows 11 will eventually become the OS I **have** to use when Windows\n10 is deprecated, much like Windows 7 before.\n\nThat was Windows 11 version 21H2. Things changed when I tried to give\nWindows 11 one more shot with 22H2. While right click menu is still\nlimited, they speed up the cold boot time to about Windows 10's time.\nTaskbar's right click menu finally got its Task Manager option back, and\nit's been redesigned to reflect the design of Windows 11. Using Windows\n11 felt a bit faster than Windows 10, especially the effects. I\ndiscovered that the Microsoft Store allows you to download apps without\nlogin into Microsoft account and I found Windows Subsystem for Linux and\nAndroid. The Android one was amazing. While YouTube didn't work, I was\nable to install\n[SmartTubeNext](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTubeNext) and played\nsome videos on it, fully hardware-accelerated. This is different than\nany emulator I have tried, which never had hardware acceleration. The\nLinux one is fine. I just don't see the appeal, beside using this when\ninstalling bare-metal or using VirtualBox is not an option. Keep in mind\nthat each subsystem **eats up about 2 GB of RAM**, so be mindful when\nusing them on anything less than **8 GB of RAM**.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/win11-taskmgr.png)\n\n#### Linux Mint\n\nI recently turned to Linux as a daily driver, after multiple incidents\nof Windows 10 on my laptop threatening me that it would update itself to\nWindows 11, and the button to skip it was a rather small one on the left\nof the screen, and you will definitely miss it, **as** Microsoft\ndesigned it so. I explored a couple of options in the Ubuntu ecosystem\nbefore settling for Lubuntu:\n\n\\- Ubuntu was a bit heavy, I wanted something leaner. Besides, when I\ntried to install it, I am stucked at partitioning. For whatever choice I\npicked, it wouldn't let me continue.\n\n\\- Xubuntu, though as light as Lubuntu with its Xfce desktop environment\ninstead of LxQt, is rather metallic in color and quite bright.\n\nUsing Lubuntu for a while, I decided to look into Linux Mint. Based on\nUbuntu, but without **Snap**, which is already a plus, it's regarded\nhighly within the Linux community for its simplicity, ease of use. Linux\nMint has a few flavors to choose:\n\n\\- Cinnamon, the team's own take on GNOME\n\n\\- MATE (read ma-te), continuation of GNOME 2\n\n\\- Xfce\n\nI chose Cinnamon, as that's the default of the OS. Here are my thought:\n\n\\- The design of the desktop is quite nice, due to it looking like\nWindows 10 but better.\n\n\\- Their Settings app works more like the Control Panel, where it's just\na collection of tools. It takes a bit getting used to, cause I'm used to\nLubuntu.\n\n\\- Most of the apps you use are available from the start, like Firefox,\noffice with LibreOffice, watch movies with Celluloid (mpv with\ninterface). However, if you wish to install more, there's a software\nmanager that you can run to install more. It works like an app store for\nyour PC.\n\n\\- Unlike Windows 10 and 11, I can choose whether to let it auto update\nor not, and update what packages. There's an app that takes care of\nthat, if not I can use **apt**.\n\nWith Ubuntu 24.04 slowly turning to force Snap as its app management to\nall users, kinda like Windows, people including me are considering\nmoving shops to Linux Mint because at least they have yet to sell like\ncorporate sellout.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/cinnamon.png)\n\n#### Elementary OS\n\nThis is another OS that is based on Ubuntu. Seems to be a running theme\nfor my choice of Oses. I guess because Ubuntu itself is popular and\nbeginner-friendly. Whenever Linux is mentioned to anybody, their first\nthoughts are Ubuntu and Debian. I began my journey to download the ISO\nfile.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/elementary.jpg)\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye is that they asked you to pay for the\nOS. I was planning to skip this OS when I tried typing zero into the\nprice and it allowed me to download again. Usually in other OSes, they\nask you before you download if you'd like to donate them some money.\nThis one essentially tricked you into thinking that you have to buy it.\nWell, maybe there's a reason for that. I installed the OS and ran it. It\nlooked very good. There have been works done to make Elementary OS look\nlike a beautiful piece of art. Quite like macOS except I liked this way\nmore. That is Pantheon desktop environment, by the way. Like Linux Mint,\nthey use software manager called AppCenter to manage all packages. But I\nhad to give this OS a pass. Because when I tried installing NVIDIA\ndriver on and restarted my PC, the desktop environment stopped showing,\nleaving the terminal behind. So there were some bugs or compatibility\nproblems with Pantheon. Maybe if I had an AMD GPU or using Intel CPU, I\ncould use it a bit longer. Shame!\n\n#### Pop OS\n\nWell, another derivative of Ubuntu developed by System76, a manufacture\nof desktops and laptops specifically for Linux. So unlike other Linux\ndistributions (or distros), this OS is not community-driven but\nmaintained by a company, so there is a degree of responsibility to\nensure their OS work perfectly on their products, and by association our\nown PCs. They use their own desktop environment, which is COSMIC, a\ncustomized GNOME. Well, not really heavily customized. I could point out\na few similarities between them. Downloading ISO was simple enough.\nThere was even a specialized version for Nvidia GPU, like in my desktop.\nStill, I tried the normal version and worked the way up. Unlike that\nbuggy Elementary OS, it actually ran after installing the GPU driver.\nThe distro was quite good even if I didn't spend as much time on it. I\nguess the experience is the same if you've used any other distros with\nGNOME desktop.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/Pop-OS-22.04-Desktop-beta.webp)\n\n#### Debian\n\nThe daddy of all distros based on it. This distro is recommended only\nfor server because of its stability, reliability. Part of it is because\nthe packages on this one are old, not as up-to-date in order to be\nstable. Unlike on my server which is running Debian 12 (bookworm), I've\ndecided to try the testing branch. And guess what, it was a bad idea.\nThe kernel update version 6.4 from the testing branch broke the OS. I\nhad to boot from an older one (5.10) to salvage it. I pulled the kernel\n6.1 from Debian 12 to run on my desktop and it worked. I installed KDE\nPlasma desktop environment, ran it in Wayland mode. (Wayland here is a\nwindow system protocol, like its predecessor, X11. Its job is to render\nwindows and any elements onscreen). And it **ran** like a turtle, CPU\nspiked to 400% on a Ryzen 5 1600 6-core. It wasn't until I installed the\nNvidia GPU driver that it got better. However, I didn't really like\nKDE's look. It's a bit rugged, square, even though I could say the same\nthing about Lubuntu's LXQt. But I did not like it. I know about GNOME\nand KDE are vastly customizable, and I would get to those one day, for\nnow it's just my first impression on the desktop environment. I later\ntried KDE on Fedora and also didn't like it, either. If you're\nacquainted with using Ubuntu, then Debian shouldn't be any different,\nsince Ubuntu derived from Debian.\n\n#### Fedora\n\nThere are so many things to say about this one that it deserves its own\narticle.\n\n#### EndeavourOS\n\nThis one is based on Arch Linux. Despite what everyone said about how\nhard it is to use it, there's even a meme \"I use Arch, btw\" meaning it's\na tough cookie to crack, I had fun with it. It's easy to use, its\npackage repository is packed with applications that have newest\nversions. Firefox is in it instead of in a container format like Snap on\nUbuntu or exists only as *firefox-esr* like Debian. It's not insane in\navoiding proprietary components at all cost like Fedora, to the\ndetriment of the usability of the OS. And it's a new kid in town, not\nsurrounded with dramas like\n[*Manjaro*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlD17OjFAc). It's only\ncrime is that its package manager,\n*p[acman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Rosetta)*, works a\nlittle different than the rest.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/Screenshot_endeavourOS.png)\n\n#### Zorin OS\n\nMuch like Linux Mint, it is based on Ubuntu and looks like Windows. It\ncomes with 2 flavors: Core in GNOME, Lite in Xfce.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/Zorin-OS-16.1-Core.png)\n#### Xero Linux\n\nBased on Arch Linux like EndeavourOS before it and also a new kid in\ntown. But while by default EndeavourOS uses Xfce, this one uses KDE\nPlasma as its beautifully crafted desktop environment, with a GNOME\ndashboard and a wobbly effect whenever I move the window.\n\n![](/images/230823-1/xerolinux.webp)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"f:Tc3e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"After multiple times compiling drivers on multiple environments,\nspecifically OpenWrt, I'd decided to see if I could compile the driver\nof my wifi adapter, [rtl8821cu](https://github.com/brektrou/rtl8821CU), for my\nRaspberry Pi 3 from my laptop. Raspberry Pi ran on DietPi, which is\nbased on Debian.\n\n#### Compile on Raspberry Pi\n\nFirst, I installed *raspberrypi-kernel-header*, which is a package\ncontaining the kernel source of Raspberry Pi. Afterwards, I ran this\ncommand to compile the driver, it worked:\n\n*make -j4*\n\nI tried out this trick I learned from r8152 source compiling, but it\nfailed:\n\n*make -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd) -j\\$(nproc)*\n\nIt didn't work when I added cross compiling parameters, either:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE= -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd)\n-j\\$(nproc)*\n\n#### Compile on x86\n\nI downloaded the [Raspberry Pi Kernel Source\nCode](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux) from Github and\ninstalled the package gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu. I used the following line\nbut that didn't work:\n\n*make -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd) -j\\$(nproc)*\n\nSo is the next one:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE= -C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e M=\\$(pwd)\n-j\\$(nproc)*\n\nAfter reading *Makefile* in the *rtl8821cu* folder and found a line at\nthe *modules* part:\n\n*\\$(MAKE) ARCH=\\$(ARCH) CROSS\\_COMPILE=\\$(CROSS\\_COMPILE) -C \\$(KSRC)\nM=\\$(shell pwd) modules*\n\nI rechecked my command line. While **ARCH, CROSS\\_COMPILE** I filled in\ncorrectly, I should be filling in **KSRC=\\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e** instead of\n**-C \\\u003ckernel source\\\u003e**.

So I did:\n\n*make ARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- oldconfig \u0026\u0026 make\nARCH=arm64 CROSS\\_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- prepare*\n\nIt asked a ton of questions though.\n\n![](/images/230722/make%20oldconfig.jpg)\n\nAbout to finish, it came out with this error.\n\n![](/images/230722/make2.jpg)\n\nI looked into line 2501 of Makefile of the driver, it was the *module*\npart, so not the place yet. Line 1929 of Makefile of the kernel source\nshowed more promise.\n\n![](/images/230722/make3.jpg)\n\nI looked into *Makefile.modfinal*. It's like the file and the error are\nboth looking for *module.lds* but it's not available in the kernel\nsource. Temporarily, I copied *module.lds.S* to *module.lds.* It did\ncompile, but it didn't work on Raspberry Pi, likely because of kernel\n6.1.21 currently on Pi, compared to kernel source 6.1.35.\n\n#### What happened if you missed ARCH and CROSS\\_COMPILE?\n\nMissing **ARCH** came out with this error.\n\n![missing arch](/images/230722/missing%20arch.jpg)\n\nMissing **CROSS\\_COMPILE** came out with this error.\n\n![missing cross compile](/images/230722/missing%20cross%20compile.jpg)\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo I guess for now I just compile the driver against the source on the\ndevice then.

I live in\nLubuntu town. That's a funny way to say that I use Lubuntu as my daily\ndriver on my laptop. On my laptop, which is an Intel i7 9750H + GTX 1060\ncombo, it's been kind to me and given me my preferred screen resolution,\nwhich was 1600x900 out of the box. That wasn't the case for my desktop,\nwhich is an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 + GTX 1060 combo, as it gave me its default\nresolution of 1920x1080. There's nothing wrong with it, other than the\nletters appear like tiny dots on screen. When I opened the Monitor\nSettings, it didn't give me 1600x900, instead there were 1920x0180,\n1680x1050, 1600x1200. Nvidia Settings certainly didn't help, it didn't\nhave 1600x900, either. So I had my work cut out for me.\n\n![](/images/230721/nvidia.jpg)\n\n#### Finding answers in vain\n\nI first tried out [this\nmethod](https://itslinuxfoss.com/set-custom-resolution-using-xrandr/)\nto set a custom resolution. However, it returned this error and wouldn't\nallow me to add that resolution:\n\n*X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)*\n\n*Major opcode of failed request: 140 (RANDR)*\n\n*Minor opcode of failed request: 18 (RRAddOutputMode)*\n\nI searched everywhere for a solution to no avail. That means, while\nthere are answers, none satisfies what I'm looking for.. So I tried the\nnext method, setting it on Nvidia's side using Nvidia Settings.\nAccording to [this\npost](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=255287),\n*you want to do this by setting your ViewPortIn to your desired\nresolution, and your Panning to the desired resolution as well. Do NOT\ntouch ViewPortOut*.\n\n![](/images/230721/lxqt-config-monitor.jpg)\n\nI applied it and saved the settings to X File. However it won't write\nthe X File **xorg.conf** down to */etc/X11/* so I have to issue a\ncommand [*sudo chmod u+x\n/usr/share/screen-resolution-extra/nvidia-polkit*](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/cant-save-to-x-configuration-file-on-nvidia-settings/185069)\nto make it work. After I'd done that, I logged out and back in.\nInterestingly, the login screen showed that the custom resolution\nworked, but as soon as I logged in*,* the screen *turned back to\n1920x1080* and Nvidia reported my screen resolution as Auto.\n\n#### Stumbled upon the solution\n\nAt that point, I was stump. Like what do I do now? I kept trying back\nand forth between two ways for hours. Nothing works. Until something\namazing happened. I read somewhere that after saving the settings on the\nNvidia's side, I should change the monitor settings from the OS side, so\nI switched it to 1680x1050, logged out, logged back in. And voila. It\nfinally clicked. I can't believe it. So I guess that's how it's done.\n\nAccording to the [official\nguide](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/persist-nvidia-x-server-settings/158102/5),\nthe desktop environment, in this case LXQt, may have overridden any\nconfiguration from nvidia-settings, hence why Lubuntu switched to\n1920x1080 after its login screen was 1600x900. The way I pulled it off\nseems like a hack, because it is. I'm supposed to either change\nresolution from the monitor settings within Lubuntu or disable any\nfeature for managing displays. But hey, as long as it works.\n\n![](/images/230721/it_work.png)"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"16:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"KqJCZiDDVDJ5SxOf3Z2CW\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"font-semibold text-2xl mb-8 tracking-tighter\",\"children\":\"My Blog\"}],[\"$\",\"$L6\",null,{\"allBlogs\":[{\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"A different mindset\",\"publishedAt\":\"2024-09-06\"},\"slug\":\"240906\",\"content\":\"$7\"},{\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"\\\"Perhaps I treated you too harshly\\\".
